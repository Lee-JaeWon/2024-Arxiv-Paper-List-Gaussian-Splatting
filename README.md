| 736 | No Pose, No Problem: Surprisingly Simple 3D Gaussian Splats from Sparse Unposed Images | Botao Ye,Sifei Liu,Haofei Xu,Xueting Li,Marc Pollefeys,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Songyou Peng | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce NoPoSplat, a feed-forward model capable of reconstructing 3D scenes parameterized by 3D Gaussians from \\textit{unposed} sparse multi-view images. Our model, trained exclusively with photometric loss, achieves real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction during inference. To eliminate the need for accurate pose input during reconstruction, we anchor one input view's local camera coordinates as the canonical space and train the network to predict Gaussian primitives for all views within this space. This approach obviates the need to transform Gaussian primitives from local coordinates into a global coordinate system, thus avoiding errors associated with per-frame Gaussians and pose estimation. To resolve scale ambiguity, we design and compare various intrinsic embedding methods, ultimately opting to convert camera intrinsics into a token embedding and concatenate it with image tokens as input to the model, enabling accurate scene scale prediction. We utilize the reconstructed 3D Gaussians for novel view synthesis and pose estimation tasks and propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine pipeline for accurate pose estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our pose-free approach can achieve superior novel view synthesis quality compared to pose-required methods, particularly in scenarios with limited input image overlap. For pose estimation, our method, trained without ground truth depth or explicit matching loss, significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with substantial improvements. This work makes significant advances in pose-free generalizable 3D reconstruction and demonstrates its applicability to real-world scenarios.

| 735 | GeoSplatting: Towards Geometry Guided Gaussian Splatting for Physically-based Inverse Rendering | Kai Ye,Chong Gao,Guanbin Li,Wenzheng Chen,Baoquan Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We consider the problem of physically-based inverse rendering using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations. While recent 3DGS methods have achieved remarkable results in novel view synthesis (NVS), accurately capturing high-fidelity geometry, physically interpretable materials and lighting remains challenging, as it requires precise geometry modeling to provide accurate surface normals, along with physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to ensure correct material and lighting disentanglement. Previous 3DGS methods resort to approximating surface normals, but often struggle with noisy local geometry, leading to inaccurate normal estimation and suboptimal material-lighting decomposition. In this paper, we introduce GeoSplatting, a novel hybrid representation that augments 3DGS with explicit geometric guidance and differentiable PBR equations. Specifically, we bridge isosurface and 3DGS together, where we first extract isosurface mesh from a scalar field, then convert it into 3DGS points and formulate PBR equations for them in a fully differentiable manner. In GeoSplatting, 3DGS is grounded on the mesh geometry, enabling precise surface normal modeling, which facilitates the use of PBR frameworks for material decomposition. This approach further maintains the efficiency and quality of NVS from 3DGS while ensuring accurate geometry from the isosurface. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the superiority of GeoSplatting, consistently outperforming existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24204](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24204) |
| 734 | WildGaussians: 3D Gaussian Splatting in the Wild | Jonas Kulhanek,Songyou Peng,Zuzana Kukelova,Marc Pollefeys,Torsten Sattler | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>While the field of 3D scene reconstruction is dominated by NeRFs due to their photorealistic quality, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged, offering similar quality with real-time rendering speeds. However, both methods primarily excel with well-controlled 3D scenes, while in-the-wild data - characterized by occlusions, dynamic objects, and varying illumination - remains challenging. NeRFs can adapt to such conditions easily through per-image embedding vectors, but 3DGS struggles due to its explicit representation and lack of shared parameters. To address this, we introduce WildGaussians, a novel approach to handle occlusions and appearance changes with 3DGS. By leveraging robust DINO features and integrating an appearance modeling module within 3DGS, our method achieves state-of-the-art results. We demonstrate that WildGaussians matches the real-time rendering speed of 3DGS while surpassing both 3DGS and NeRF baselines in handling in-the-wild data, all within a simple architectural framework.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08447](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08447) |
| 733 | Subsurface Scattering for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Jan-Niklas Dihlmann,Arjun Majumdar,Andreas Engelhardt,Raphael Braun,Hendrik P. A. Lensch | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D reconstruction and relighting of objects made from scattering materials present a significant challenge due to the complex light transport beneath the surface. 3D Gaussian Splatting introduced high-quality novel view synthesis at real-time speeds. While 3D Gaussians efficiently approximate an object's surface, they fail to capture the volumetric properties of subsurface scattering. We propose a framework for optimizing an object's shape together with the radiance transfer field given multi-view OLAT (one light at a time) data. Our method decomposes the scene into an explicit surface represented as 3D Gaussians, with a spatially varying BRDF, and an implicit volumetric representation of the scattering component. A learned incident light field accounts for shadowing. We optimize all parameters jointly via ray-traced differentiable rendering. Our approach enables material editing, relighting and novel view synthesis at interactive rates. We show successful application on synthetic data and introduce a newly acquired multi-view multi-light dataset of objects in a light-stage setup. Compared to previous work we achieve comparable or better results at a fraction of optimization and rendering time while enabling detailed control over material attributes.

| 732 | GaussianMarker: Uncertainty-Aware Copyright Protection of 3D Gaussian Splatting | Xiufeng Huang,Ruiqi Li,Yiu-ming Cheung,Ka Chun Cheung,Simon See,Renjie Wan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a crucial method for acquiring 3D assets. To protect the copyright of these assets, digital watermarking techniques can be applied to embed ownership information discreetly within 3DGS models. However, existing watermarking methods for meshes, point clouds, and implicit radiance fields cannot be directly applied to 3DGS models, as 3DGS models use explicit 3D Gaussians with distinct structures and do not rely on neural networks. Naively embedding the watermark on a pre-trained 3DGS can cause obvious distortion in rendered images. In our work, we propose an uncertainty-based method that constrains the perturbation of model parameters to achieve invisible watermarking for 3DGS. At the message decoding stage, the copyright messages can be reliably extracted from both 3D Gaussians and 2D rendered images even under various forms of 3D and 2D distortions. We conduct extensive experiments on the Blender, LLFF and MipNeRF-360 datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both message decoding accuracy and view synthesis quality.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23718](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23718) |
| 731 | Epipolar-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting for Generalizable Novel View Synthesis | Zhiyuan Min,Yawei Luo,Jianwen Sun,Yi Yang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Generalizable 3D Gaussian splitting (3DGS) can reconstruct new scenes from sparse-view observations in a feed-forward inference manner, eliminating the need for scene-specific retraining required in conventional 3DGS. However, existing methods rely heavily on epipolar priors, which can be unreliable in complex realworld scenes, particularly in non-overlapping and occluded regions. In this paper, we propose eFreeSplat, an efficient feed-forward 3DGS-based model for generalizable novel view synthesis that operates independently of epipolar line constraints. To enhance multiview feature extraction with 3D perception, we employ a selfsupervised Vision Transformer (ViT) with cross-view completion pre-training on large-scale datasets. Additionally, we introduce an Iterative Cross-view Gaussians Alignment method to ensure consistent depth scales across different views. Our eFreeSplat represents an innovative approach for generalizable novel view synthesis. Different from the existing pure geometry-free methods, eFreeSplat focuses more on achieving epipolar-free feature matching and encoding by providing 3D priors through cross-view pretraining. We evaluate eFreeSplat on wide-baseline novel view synthesis tasks using the RealEstate10K and ACID datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that eFreeSplat surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that rely on epipolar priors, achieving superior geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis quality.

| 730 | GS-Blur: A 3D Scene-Based Dataset for Realistic Image Deblurring | Dongwoo Lee,Joonkyu Park,Kyoung Mu Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>To train a deblurring network, an appropriate dataset with paired blurry and sharp images is essential. Existing datasets collect blurry images either synthetically by aggregating consecutive sharp frames or using sophisticated camera systems to capture real blur. However, these methods offer limited diversity in blur types (blur trajectories) or require extensive human effort to reconstruct large-scale datasets, failing to fully reflect real-world blur scenarios. To address this, we propose GS-Blur, a dataset of synthesized realistic blurry images created using a novel approach. To this end, we first reconstruct 3D scenes from multi-view images using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), then render blurry images by moving the camera view along the randomly generated motion trajectories. By adopting various camera trajectories in reconstructing our GS-Blur, our dataset contains realistic and diverse types of blur, offering a large-scale dataset that generalizes well to real-world blur. Using GS-Blur with various deblurring methods, we demonstrate its ability to generalize effectively compared to previous synthetic or real blur datasets, showing significant improvements in deblurring performance.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23658](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23658) |
| 729 | DistillNeRF: Perceiving 3D Scenes from Single-Glance Images by Distilling Neural Fields and Foundation Model Features | Letian Wang,Seung Wook Kim,Jiawei Yang,Cunjun Yu,Boris Ivanovic,Steven L. Waslander,Yue Wang,Sanja Fidler,Marco Pavone,Peter Karkus | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose DistillNeRF, a self-supervised learning framework addressing the challenge of understanding 3D environments from limited 2D observations in outdoor autonomous driving scenes. Our method is a generalizable feedforward model that predicts a rich neural scene representation from sparse, single-frame multi-view camera inputs with limited view overlap, and is trained self-supervised with differentiable rendering to reconstruct RGB, depth, or feature images. Our first insight is to exploit per-scene optimized Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) by generating dense depth and virtual camera targets from them, which helps our model to learn enhanced 3D geometry from sparse non-overlapping image inputs. Second, to learn a semantically rich 3D representation, we propose distilling features from pre-trained 2D foundation models, such as CLIP or DINOv2, thereby enabling various downstream tasks without the need for costly 3D human annotations. To leverage these two insights, we introduce a novel model architecture with a two-stage lift-splat-shoot encoder and a parameterized sparse hierarchical voxel representation. Experimental results on the NuScenes and Waymo NOTR datasets demonstrate that DistillNeRF significantly outperforms existing comparable state-of-the-art self-supervised methods for scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and depth estimation; and it allows for competitive zero-shot 3D semantic occupancy prediction, as well as open-world scene understanding through distilled foundation model features. Demos and code will be available at https://distillnerf.github.io/.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12095](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12095) |
| 728 | GeoGS3D: Single-view 3D Reconstruction via Geometric-aware Diffusion Model and Gaussian Splatting | Qijun Feng,Zhen Xing,Zuxuan Wu,Yu-Gang Jiang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce GeoGS3D, a novel two-stage framework for reconstructing detailed 3D objects from single-view images. Inspired by the success of pre-trained 2D diffusion models, our method incorporates an orthogonal plane decomposition mechanism to extract 3D geometric features from the 2D input, facilitating the generation of multi-view consistent images. During the following Gaussian Splatting, these images are fused with epipolar attention, fully utilizing the geometric correlations across views. Moreover, we propose a novel metric, Gaussian Divergence Significance (GDS), to prune unnecessary operations during optimization, significantly accelerating the reconstruction process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoGS3D generates images with high consistency across views and reconstructs high-quality 3D objects, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10242](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10242) |
| 727 | Next Best Sense: Guiding Vision and Touch with FisherRF for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Matthew Strong,Boshu Lei,Aiden Swann,Wen Jiang,Kostas Daniilidis,Monroe Kennedy III | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose a framework for active next best view and touch selection for robotic manipulators using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). 3DGS is emerging as a useful explicit 3D scene representation for robotics, as it has the ability to represent scenes in a both photorealistic and geometrically accurate manner. However, in real-world, online robotic scenes where the number of views is limited given efficiency requirements, random view selection for 3DGS becomes impractical as views are often overlapping and redundant. We address this issue by proposing an end-to-end online training and active view selection pipeline, which enhances the performance of 3DGS in few-view robotics settings. We first elevate the performance of few-shot 3DGS with a novel semantic depth alignment method using Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) that we supplement with Pearson depth and surface normal loss to improve color and depth reconstruction of real-world scenes. We then extend FisherRF, a next-best-view selection method for 3DGS, to select views and touch poses based on depth uncertainty. We perform online view selection on a real robot system during live 3DGS training. We motivate our improvements to few-shot GS scenes, and extend depth-based FisherRF to them, where we demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements on challenging robot scenes.

| 726 | DisC-GS: Discontinuity-aware Gaussian Splatting | Haoxuan Qu,Zhuoling Li,Hossein Rahmani,Yujun Cai,Jun Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, Gaussian Splatting, a method that represents a 3D scene as a collection of Gaussian distributions, has gained significant attention in addressing the task of novel view synthesis. In this paper, we highlight a fundamental limitation of Gaussian Splatting: its inability to accurately render discontinuities and boundaries in images due to the continuous nature of Gaussian distributions. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework enabling Gaussian Splatting to perform discontinuity-aware image rendering. Additionally, we introduce a B\xc3\xa9zier-boundary gradient approximation strategy within our framework to keep the "differentiability" of the proposed discontinuity-aware rendering process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our framework.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15196](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15196) |
| 725 | ELMGS: Enhancing memory and computation scaLability through coMpression for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Muhammad Salman Ali,Sung-Ho Bae,Enzo Tartaglione | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D models have recently been popularized by the potentiality of end-to-end training offered first by Neural Radiance Fields and most recently by 3D Gaussian Splatting models. The latter has the big advantage of naturally providing fast training convergence and high editability. However, as the research around these is still in its infancy, there is still a gap in the literature regarding the model's scalability. In this work, we propose an approach enabling both memory and computation scalability of such models. More specifically, we propose an iterative pruning strategy that removes redundant information encoded in the model. We also enhance compressibility for the model by including in the optimization strategy a differentiable quantization and entropy coding estimator. Our results on popular benchmarks showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach and open the road to the broad deployability of such a solution even on resource-constrained devices.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23213](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23213) |
| 724 | HumanSplat: Generalizable Single-Image Human Gaussian Splatting with Structure Priors | Panwang Pan,Zhuo Su,Chenguo Lin,Zhen Fan,Yongjie Zhang,Zeming Li,Tingting Shen,Yadong Mu,Yebin Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Despite recent advancements in high-fidelity human reconstruction techniques, the requirements for densely captured images or time-consuming per-instance optimization significantly hinder their applications in broader scenarios. To tackle these issues, we present HumanSplat which predicts the 3D Gaussian Splatting properties of any human from a single input image in a generalizable manner. In particular, HumanSplat comprises a 2D multi-view diffusion model and a latent reconstruction transformer with human structure priors that adeptly integrate geometric priors and semantic features within a unified framework. A hierarchical loss that incorporates human semantic information is further designed to achieve high-fidelity texture modeling and better constrain the estimated multiple views. Comprehensive experiments on standard benchmarks and in-the-wild images demonstrate that HumanSplat surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in achieving photorealistic novel-view synthesis.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12459](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12459) |
| 723 | ES-Gaussian: Gaussian Splatting Mapping via Error Space-Based Gaussian Completion | Lu Chen,Yingfu Zeng,Haoang Li,Zhitao Deng,Jiafu Yan,Zhenjun Zhao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Accurate and affordable indoor 3D reconstruction is critical for effective robot navigation and interaction. Traditional LiDAR-based mapping provides high precision but is costly, heavy, and power-intensive, with limited ability for novel view rendering. Vision-based mapping, while cost-effective and capable of capturing visual data, often struggles with high-quality 3D reconstruction due to sparse point clouds. We propose ES-Gaussian, an end-to-end system using a low-altitude camera and single-line LiDAR for high-quality 3D indoor reconstruction. Our system features Visual Error Construction (VEC) to enhance sparse point clouds by identifying and correcting areas with insufficient geometric detail from 2D error maps. Additionally, we introduce a novel 3DGS initialization method guided by single-line LiDAR, overcoming the limitations of traditional multi-view setups and enabling effective reconstruction in resource-constrained environments. Extensive experimental results on our new Dreame-SR dataset and a publicly available dataset demonstrate that ES-Gaussian outperforms existing methods, particularly in challenging scenarios.

| 722 | VCR-GauS: View Consistent Depth-Normal Regularizer for Gaussian Surface Reconstruction | Hanlin Chen,Fangyin Wei,Chen Li,Tianxin Huang,Yunsong Wang,Gim Hee Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Although 3D Gaussian Splatting has been widely studied because of its realistic and efficient novel-view synthesis, it is still challenging to extract a high-quality surface from the point-based representation. Previous works improve the surface by incorporating geometric priors from the off-the-shelf normal estimator. However, there are two main limitations: 1) Supervising normals rendered from 3D Gaussians effectively updates the rotation parameter but is less effective for other geometric parameters; 2) The inconsistency of predicted normal maps across multiple views may lead to severe reconstruction artifacts. In this paper, we propose a Depth-Normal regularizer that directly couples normal with other geometric parameters, leading to full updates of the geometric parameters from normal regularization. We further propose a confidence term to mitigate inconsistencies of normal predictions across multiple views. Moreover, we also introduce a densification and splitting strategy to regularize the size and distribution of 3D Gaussians for more accurate surface modeling. Compared with Gaussian-based baselines, experiments show that our approach obtains better reconstruction quality and maintains competitive appearance quality at faster training speed and 100+ FPS rendering.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05774](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05774) |
| 721 | Geometry Cloak: Preventing TGS-based 3D Reconstruction from Copyrighted Images | Qi Song,Ziyuan Luo,Ka Chun Cheung,Simon See,Renjie Wan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Single-view 3D reconstruction methods like Triplane Gaussian Splatting (TGS) have enabled high-quality 3D model generation from just a single image input within seconds. However, this capability raises concerns about potential misuse, where malicious users could exploit TGS to create unauthorized 3D models from copyrighted images. To prevent such infringement, we propose a novel image protection approach that embeds invisible geometry perturbations, termed "geometry cloaks", into images before supplying them to TGS. These carefully crafted perturbations encode a customized message that is revealed when TGS attempts 3D reconstructions of the cloaked image. Unlike conventional adversarial attacks that simply degrade output quality, our method forces TGS to fail the 3D reconstruction in a specific way - by generating an identifiable customized pattern that acts as a watermark. This watermark allows copyright holders to assert ownership over any attempted 3D reconstructions made from their protected images. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of our geometry cloak. Our project is available at https://qsong2001.github.io/geometry_cloak.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22705](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22705) |
| 720 | DiffGS: Functional Gaussian Splatting Diffusion | Junsheng Zhou,Weiqi Zhang,Yu-Shen Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown convincing performance in rendering speed and fidelity, yet the generation of Gaussian Splatting remains a challenge due to its discreteness and unstructured nature. In this work, we propose DiffGS, a general Gaussian generator based on latent diffusion models. DiffGS is a powerful and efficient 3D generative model which is capable of generating Gaussian primitives at arbitrary numbers for high-fidelity rendering with rasterization. The key insight is to represent Gaussian Splatting in a disentangled manner via three novel functions to model Gaussian probabilities, colors and transforms. Through the novel disentanglement of 3DGS, we represent the discrete and unstructured 3DGS with continuous Gaussian Splatting functions, where we then train a latent diffusion model with the target of generating these Gaussian Splatting functions both unconditionally and conditionally. Meanwhile, we introduce a discretization algorithm to extract Gaussians at arbitrary numbers from the generated functions via octree-guided sampling and optimization. We explore DiffGS for various tasks, including unconditional generation, conditional generation from text, image, and partial 3DGS, as well as Point-to-Gaussian generation. We believe that DiffGS provides a new direction for flexibly modeling and generating Gaussian Splatting.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19657](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19657) |
| 719 | EVER: Exact Volumetric Ellipsoid Rendering for Real-time View Synthesis | Alexander Mai,Peter Hedman,George Kopanas,Dor Verbin,David Futschik,Qiangeng Xu,Falko Kuester,Jonathan T. Barron,Yinda Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present Exact Volumetric Ellipsoid Rendering (EVER), a method for real-time differentiable emission-only volume rendering. Unlike recent rasterization based approach by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), our primitive based representation allows for exact volume rendering, rather than alpha compositing 3D Gaussian billboards. As such, unlike 3DGS our formulation does not suffer from popping artifacts and view dependent density, but still achieves frame rates of $\\sim\\!30$ FPS at 720p on an NVIDIA RTX4090. Since our approach is built upon ray tracing it enables effects such as defocus blur and camera distortion (e.g. such as from fisheye cameras), which are difficult to achieve by rasterization. We show that our method is more accurate with fewer blending issues than 3DGS and follow-up work on view-consistent rendering, especially on the challenging large-scale scenes from the Zip-NeRF dataset where it achieves sharpest results among real-time techniques.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01804](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01804) |
| 718 | GStex: Per-Primitive Texturing of 2D Gaussian Splatting for Decoupled Appearance and Geometry Modeling | Victor Rong,Jingxiang Chen,Sherwin Bahmani,Kiriakos N. Kutulakos,David B. Lindell | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian splatting has demonstrated excellent performance for view synthesis and scene reconstruction. The representation achieves photorealistic quality by optimizing the position, scale, color, and opacity of thousands to millions of 2D or 3D Gaussian primitives within a scene. However, since each Gaussian primitive encodes both appearance and geometry, these attributes are strongly coupled--thus, high-fidelity appearance modeling requires a large number of Gaussian primitives, even when the scene geometry is simple (e.g., for a textured planar surface). We propose to texture each 2D Gaussian primitive so that even a single Gaussian can be used to capture appearance details. By employing per-primitive texturing, our appearance representation is agnostic to the topology and complexity of the scene's geometry. We show that our approach, GStex, yields improved visual quality over prior work in texturing Gaussian splats. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our decoupling enables improved novel view synthesis performance compared to 2D Gaussian splatting when reducing the number of Gaussian primitives, and that GStex can be used for scene appearance editing and re-texturing.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12954](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12954) |
| 717 | GSD: View-Guided Gaussian Splatting Diffusion for 3D Reconstruction | Yuxuan Mu,Xinxin Zuo,Chuan Guo,Yilin Wang,Juwei Lu,Xiaofeng Wu,Songcen Xu,Peng Dai,Youliang Yan,Li Cheng | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present GSD, a diffusion model approach based on Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation for 3D object reconstruction from a single view. Prior works suffer from inconsistent 3D geometry or mediocre rendering quality due to improper representations. We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings by utilizing the recent state-of-the-art 3D explicit representation, Gaussian Splatting, and an unconditional diffusion model. This model learns to generate 3D objects represented by sets of GS ellipsoids. With these strong generative 3D priors, though learning unconditionally, the diffusion model is ready for view-guided reconstruction without further model fine-tuning. This is achieved by propagating fine-grained 2D features through the efficient yet flexible splatting function and the guided denoising sampling process. In addition, a 2D diffusion model is further employed to enhance rendering fidelity, and improve reconstructed GS quality by polishing and re-using the rendered images. The final reconstructed objects explicitly come with high-quality 3D structure and texture, and can be efficiently rendered in arbitrary views. Experiments on the challenging real-world CO3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

| 716 | PF3plat: Pose-Free Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting | Sunghwan Hong,Jaewoo Jung,Heeseong Shin,Jisang Han,Jiaolong Yang,Chong Luo,Seungryong Kim | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We consider the problem of novel view synthesis from unposed images in a single feed-forward. Our framework capitalizes on fast speed, scalability, and high-quality 3D reconstruction and view synthesis capabilities of 3DGS, where we further extend it to offer a practical solution that relaxes common assumptions such as dense image views, accurate camera poses, and substantial image overlaps. We achieve this through identifying and addressing unique challenges arising from the use of pixel-aligned 3DGS: misaligned 3D Gaussians across different views induce noisy or sparse gradients that destabilize training and hinder convergence, especially when above assumptions are not met. To mitigate this, we employ pre-trained monocular depth estimation and visual correspondence models to achieve coarse alignments of 3D Gaussians. We then introduce lightweight, learnable modules to refine depth and pose estimates from the coarse alignments, improving the quality of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Furthermore, the refined estimates are leveraged to estimate geometry confidence scores, which assess the reliability of 3D Gaussian centers and condition the prediction of Gaussian parameters accordingly. Extensive evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that PF3plat sets a new state-of-the-art across all benchmarks, supported by comprehensive ablation studies validating our design choices.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22128](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22128) |
| 715 | FreeGaussian: Guidance-free Controllable 3D Gaussian Splats with Flow Derivatives | Qizhi Chen,Delin Qu,Yiwen Tang,Haoming Song,Yiting Zhang,Dong Wang,Bin Zhao,Xuelong Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing controllable Gaussian splats from monocular video is a challenging task due to its inherently insufficient constraints. Widely adopted approaches supervise complex interactions with additional masks and control signal annotations, limiting their real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an annotation guidance-free method, dubbed FreeGaussian, that mathematically derives dynamic Gaussian motion from optical flow and camera motion using novel dynamic Gaussian constraints. By establishing a connection between 2D flows and 3D Gaussian dynamic control, our method enables self-supervised optimization and continuity of dynamic Gaussian motions from flow priors. Furthermore, we introduce a 3D spherical vector controlling scheme, which represents the state with a 3D Gaussian trajectory, thereby eliminating the need for complex 1D control signal calculations and simplifying controllable Gaussian modeling.

| 714 | DOGS: Distributed-Oriented Gaussian Splatting for Large-Scale 3D Reconstruction Via Gaussian Consensus | Yu Chen,Gim Hee Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) show promising results on the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. With its superior rendering performance and high-fidelity rendering quality, 3DGS is excelling at its previous NeRF counterparts. The most recent 3DGS method focuses either on improving the instability of rendering efficiency or reducing the model size. On the other hand, the training efficiency of 3DGS on large-scale scenes has not gained much attention. In this work, we propose DoGaussian, a method that trains 3DGS distributedly. Our method first decomposes a scene into K blocks and then introduces the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) into the training procedure of 3DGS. During training, our DOGS maintains one global 3DGS model on the master node and K local 3DGS models on the slave nodes. The K local 3DGS models are dropped after training and we only query the global 3DGS model during inference. The training time is reduced by scene decomposition, and the training convergence and stability are guaranteed through the consensus on the shared 3D Gaussians. Our method accelerates the training of 3DGS by 6+ times when evaluated on large-scale scenes while concurrently achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality.

Taking advantage of efficient and realistic rendering, the system establishes a unified framework for online mapping, viewpoint selection, and path planning. The key to ActiveSplat is a hybrid map representation that integrates both dense information about the environment and a sparse abstraction of the workspace. Therefore, the system leverages sparse topology for efficient viewpoint sampling and path planning, while exploiting view-dependent dense prediction for viewpoint selection, facilitating efficient decision-making with promising accuracy and completeness. A hierarchical planning strategy based on the topological map is adopted to mitigate repetitive trajectories and improve local granularity given limited budgets, ensuring high-fidelity reconstruction with photorealistic view synthesis. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of reconstruction accuracy, data coverage, and exploration efficiency.

| 712 | MoDGS: Dynamic Gaussian Splatting from Casually-captured Monocular Videos | Qingming Liu,Yuan Liu,Jiepeng Wang,Xianqiang Lyv,Peng Wang,Wenping Wang,Junhui Hou | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we propose MoDGS, a new pipeline to render novel views of dy namic scenes from a casually captured monocular video. Previous monocular dynamic NeRF or Gaussian Splatting methods strongly rely on the rapid move ment of input cameras to construct multiview consistency but struggle to recon struct dynamic scenes on casually captured input videos whose cameras are either static or move slowly. To address this challenging task, MoDGS adopts recent single-view depth estimation methods to guide the learning of the dynamic scene. Then, a novel 3D-aware initialization method is proposed to learn a reasonable deformation field and a new robust depth loss is proposed to guide the learning of dynamic scene geometry. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MoDGS is able to render high-quality novel view images of dynamic scenes from just a casually captured monocular video, which outperforms state-of-the-art meth ods by a significant margin.

However, the current 3D Gaussian Splatting system only supports radiance field reconstruction using undistorted perspective images. In this paper, we present OmniGS, a novel omnidirectional Gaussian splatting system, to take advantage of omnidirectional images for fast radiance field reconstruction. Specifically, we conduct a theoretical analysis of spherical camera model derivatives in 3D Gaussian Splatting. According to the derivatives, we then implement a new GPU-accelerated omnidirectional rasterizer that directly splats 3D Gaussians onto the equirectangular screen space for omnidirectional image rendering. We realize differentiable optimization of the omnidirectional radiance field without the requirement of cube-map rectification or tangent-plane approximation. Extensive experiments conducted in egocentric and roaming scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and high rendering speed using omnidirectional images.

However, existing generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting methods are largely confined to narrow-range interpolation between stereo images due to their heavy backbones, thus lacking the ability to accurately localize 3D Gaussian and support free-view synthesis across wide view range. In this paper, we present a novel framework FreeSplat that is capable of reconstructing geometrically consistent 3D scenes from long sequence input towards free-view synthesis.Specifically, we firstly introduce Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation achieved by constructing adaptive cost volumes among nearby views and aggregating features using a multi-scale structure. Subsequently, we present the Pixel-wise Triplet Fusion to eliminate redundancy of 3D Gaussians in overlapping view regions and to aggregate features observed across multiple views. Additionally, we propose a simple but effective free-view training strategy that ensures robust view synthesis across broader view range regardless of the number of views. Our empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art novel view synthesis peformances in both novel view rendered color maps quality and depth maps accuracy across different numbers of input views. We also show that FreeSplat performs inference more efficiently and can effectively reduce redundant Gaussians, offering the possibility of feed-forward large scene reconstruction without depth priors.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17958](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17958) |
| 709 | HDRGS: High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting | Jiahao Wu,Lu Xiao,Chao Wang,Rui Peng,Kaiqiang Xiong,Ronggang Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent years have witnessed substantial advancements in the field of 3D reconstruction from 2D images, particularly following the introduction of the neural radiance field (NeRF) technique. However, reconstructing a 3D high dynamic range (HDR) radiance field, which aligns more closely with real-world conditions, from 2D multi-exposure low dynamic range (LDR) images continues to pose significant challenges. Approaches to this issue fall into two categories: grid-based and implicit-based. Implicit methods, using multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), face inefficiencies, limited solvability, and overfitting risks. Conversely, grid-based methods require significant memory and struggle with image quality and long training times. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Splatting-a recent, high-quality, real-time 3D reconstruction technique-into this domain. We further develop the High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting (HDR-GS) method, designed to address the aforementioned challenges. This method enhances color dimensionality by including luminance and uses an asymmetric grid for tone-mapping, swiftly and precisely converting pixel irradiance to color. Our approach improves HDR scene recovery accuracy and integrates a novel coarse-to-fine strategy to speed up model convergence, enhancing robustness against sparse viewpoints and exposure extremes, and preventing local optima. Extensive testing confirms that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06543](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06543) |
| 708 | MVSDet: Multi-View Indoor 3D Object Detection via Efficient Plane Sweeps | Yating Xu,Chen Li,Gim Hee Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The key challenge of multi-view indoor 3D object detection is to infer accurate geometry information from images for precise 3D detection. Previous method relies on NeRF for geometry reasoning. However, the geometry extracted from NeRF is generally inaccurate, which leads to sub-optimal detection performance. In this paper, we propose MVSDet which utilizes plane sweep for geometry-aware 3D object detection. To circumvent the requirement for a large number of depth planes for accurate depth prediction, we design a probabilistic sampling and soft weighting mechanism to decide the placement of pixel features on the 3D volume. We select multiple locations that score top in the probability volume for each pixel and use their probability score to indicate the confidence. We further apply recent pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting to regularize depth prediction and improve detection performance with little computation overhead. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and ARKitScenes datasets are conducted to show the superiority of our model.

| 707 | Grid4D: 4D Decomposed Hash Encoding for High-fidelity Dynamic Gaussian Splatting | Jiawei Xu,Zexin Fan,Jian Yang,Jin Xie | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, Gaussian splatting has received more and more attention in the field of static scene rendering. Due to the low computational overhead and inherent flexibility of explicit representations, plane-based explicit methods are popular ways to predict deformations for Gaussian-based dynamic scene rendering models. However, plane-based methods rely on the inappropriate low-rank assumption and excessively decompose the space-time 4D encoding, resulting in overmuch feature overlap and unsatisfactory rendering quality. To tackle these problems, we propose Grid4D, a dynamic scene rendering model based on Gaussian splatting and employing a novel explicit encoding method for the 4D input through the hash encoding. Different from plane-based explicit representations, we decompose the 4D encoding into one spatial and three temporal 3D hash encodings without the low-rank assumption. Additionally, we design a novel attention module that generates the attention scores in a directional range to aggregate the spatial and temporal features. The directional attention enables Grid4D to more accurately fit the diverse deformations across distinct scene components based on the spatial encoded features. Moreover, to mitigate the inherent lack of smoothness in explicit representation methods, we introduce a smooth regularization term that keeps our model from the chaos of deformation prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that Grid4D significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in visual quality and rendering speed.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20815](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20815) |

The emergence of Gaussian Splatting technology has enabled the rendering of Gaussian avatars with superior visual quality and reduced computational costs. Despite numerous methods researchers propose for implementing drivable Gaussian avatars, limited attention has been given to balancing visual quality and computational costs. In this paper, we introduce LoDAvatar, a method that introduces levels of detail into Gaussian avatars through hierarchical embedding and selective detail enhancement methods. The key steps of LoDAvatar encompass data preparation, Gaussian embedding, Gaussian optimization, and selective detail enhancement. We conducted experiments involving Gaussian avatars at various levels of detail, employing both objective assessments and subjective evaluations. The outcomes indicate that incorporating levels of detail into Gaussian avatars can decrease computational costs during rendering while upholding commendable visual quality, thereby enhancing runtime frame rates. We advocate adopting LoDAvatar to render multiple dynamic Gaussian avatars or extensive Gaussian scenes to balance visual quality and computational costs.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20789](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20789) |

While generating a single high-quality 3D object is now feasible, generating multiple objects with reasonable interactions within a 3D space, a.k.a. compositional 3D generation, presents substantial challenges. This paper introduces CompGS, a novel generative framework that employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) for efficient, compositional text-to-3D content generation. To achieve this goal, two core designs are proposed: (1) 3D Gaussians Initialization with 2D compositionality: We transfer the well-established 2D compositionality to initialize the Gaussian parameters on an entity-by-entity basis, ensuring both consistent 3D priors for each entity and reasonable interactions among multiple entities; (2) Dynamic Optimization: We propose a dynamic strategy to optimize 3D Gaussians using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. CompGS first automatically decomposes 3D Gaussians into distinct entity parts, enabling optimization at both the entity and composition levels. Additionally, CompGS optimizes across objects of varying scales by dynamically adjusting the spatial parameters of each entity, enhancing the generation of fine-grained details, particularly in smaller entities. Qualitative comparisons and quantitative evaluations on T3Bench demonstrate the effectiveness of CompGS in generating compositional 3D objects with superior image quality and semantic alignment over existing methods. CompGS can also be easily extended to controllable 3D editing, facilitating scene generation. We hope CompGS will provide new insights to the compositional 3D generation.

| 704 | ODGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction from Omnidirectional Images with 3D Gaussian Splattings | Suyoung Lee,Jaeyoung Chung,Jaeyoo Huh,Kyoung Mu Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Omnidirectional (or 360-degree) images are increasingly being used for 3D applications since they allow the rendering of an entire scene with a single image. Existing works based on neural radiance fields demonstrate successful 3D reconstruction quality on egocentric videos, yet they suffer from long training and rendering times. Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has gained attention for its fast optimization and real-time rendering. However, directly using a perspective rasterizer to omnidirectional images results in severe distortion due to the different optical properties between two image domains. In this work, we present ODGS, a novel rasterization pipeline for omnidirectional images, with geometric interpretation. For each Gaussian, we define a tangent plane that touches the unit sphere and is perpendicular to the ray headed toward the Gaussian center. We then leverage a perspective camera rasterizer to project the Gaussian onto the corresponding tangent plane. The projected Gaussians are transformed and combined into the omnidirectional image, finalizing the omnidirectional rasterization process. This interpretation reveals the implicit assumptions within the proposed pipeline, which we verify through mathematical proofs. The entire rasterization process is parallelized using CUDA, achieving optimization and rendering speeds 100 times faster than NeRF-based methods. Our comprehensive experiments highlight the superiority of ODGS by delivering the best reconstruction and perceptual quality across various datasets. Additionally, results on roaming datasets demonstrate that ODGS restores fine details effectively, even when reconstructing large 3D scenes.

| 703 | Normal-GS: 3D Gaussian Splatting with Normal-Involved Rendering | Meng Wei,Qianyi Wu,Jianmin Zheng,Hamid Rezatofighi,Jianfei Cai | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Rendering and reconstruction are long-standing topics in computer vision and graphics. Achieving both high rendering quality and accurate geometry is a challenge. Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-fidelity novel view synthesis at real-time speeds. However, the noisy and discrete nature of 3D Gaussian primitives hinders accurate surface estimation. Previous attempts to regularize 3D Gaussian normals often degrade rendering quality due to the fundamental disconnect between normal vectors and the rendering pipeline in 3DGS-based methods. Therefore, we introduce Normal-GS, a novel approach that integrates normal vectors into the 3DGS rendering pipeline. The core idea is to model the interaction between normals and incident lighting using the physically-based rendering equation. Our approach re-parameterizes surface colors as the product of normals and a designed Integrated Directional Illumination Vector (IDIV). To optimize memory usage and simplify optimization, we employ an anchor-based 3DGS to implicitly encode locally-shared IDIVs. Additionally, Normal-GS leverages optimized normals and Integrated Directional Encoding (IDE) to accurately model specular effects, enhancing both rendering quality and surface normal precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Normal-GS achieves near state-of-the-art visual quality while obtaining accurate surface normals and preserving real-time rendering performance.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20593](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20593) |

However, its potential in volumetric reconstruction tasks, such as X-ray computed tomography, remains under-explored. This paper introduces R$^2$-Gaussian, the first 3DGS-based framework for sparse-view tomographic reconstruction. By carefully deriving X-ray rasterization functions, we discover a previously unknown integration bias in the standard 3DGS formulation, which hampers accurate volume retrieval. To address this issue, we propose a novel rectification technique via refactoring the projection from 3D to 2D Gaussians. Our new method presents three key innovations: (1) introducing tailored Gaussian kernels, (2) extending rasterization to X-ray imaging, and (3) developing a CUDA-based differentiable voxelizer. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy and efficiency.

| 701 | Binocular-Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting with View Consistency for Sparse View Synthesis | Liang Han,Junsheng Zhou,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis from sparse inputs is a vital yet challenging task in 3D computer vision. Previous methods explore 3D Gaussian Splatting with neural priors (e.g. depth priors) as an additional supervision, demonstrating promising quality and efficiency compared to the NeRF based methods. However, the neural priors from 2D pretrained models are often noisy and blurry, which struggle to precisely guide the learning of radiance fields. In this paper, We propose a novel method for synthesizing novel views from sparse views with Gaussian Splatting that does not require external prior as supervision. Our key idea lies in exploring the self-supervisions inherent in the binocular stereo consistency between each pair of binocular images constructed with disparity-guided image warping. To this end, we additionally introduce a Gaussian opacity constraint which regularizes the Gaussian locations and avoids Gaussian redundancy for improving the robustness and efficiency of inferring 3D Gaussians from sparse views. Extensive experiments on the LLFF, DTU, and Blender datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18822](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18822) |

The rendered HDR images capture a wider range of brightness levels containing more details of the scene than normal low dynamic range (LDR) images. Existing HDR NVS methods are mainly based on NeRF. They suffer from long training time and slow inference speed. In this paper, we propose a new framework, High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting (HDR-GS), which can efficiently render novel HDR views and reconstruct LDR images with a user input exposure time. Specifically, we design a Dual Dynamic Range (DDR) Gaussian point cloud model that uses spherical harmonics to fit HDR color and employs an MLP-based tone-mapper to render LDR color. The HDR and LDR colors are then fed into two Parallel Differentiable Rasterization (PDR) processes to reconstruct HDR and LDR views. To establish the data foundation for the research of 3D Gaussian splatting-based methods in HDR NVS, we recalibrate the camera parameters and compute the initial positions for Gaussian point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that our HDR-GS surpasses the state-of-the-art NeRF-based method by 3.84 and 1.91 dB on LDR and HDR NVS while enjoying 1000x inference speed and only requiring 6.3% training time.

When rendering novel view X-ray projections, existing methods mainly based on NeRF suffer from long training time and slow inference speed. In this paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework, namely X-Gaussian, for X-ray novel view synthesis. Firstly, we redesign a radiative Gaussian point cloud model inspired by the isotropic nature of X-ray imaging. Our model excludes the influence of view direction when learning to predict the radiation intensity of 3D points. Based on this model, we develop a Differentiable Radiative Rasterization (DRR) with CUDA implementation. Secondly, we customize an Angle-pose Cuboid Uniform Initialization (ACUI) strategy that directly uses the parameters of the X-ray scanner to compute the camera information and then uniformly samples point positions within a cuboid enclosing the scanned object. Experiments show that our X-Gaussian outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 6.5 dB while enjoying less than 15% training time and over 73x inference speed. The application on sparse-view CT reconstruction also reveals the practical values of our method. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/X-Gaussian .

This unique characteristic of scene representation and per-scene training distinguishes radiance field models from other neural models, because complex scenes necessitate models with higher representational capacity and vice versa.

| 695 | ArCSEM: Artistic Colorization of SEM Images via Gaussian Splatting | Takuma Nishimura,Andreea Dogaru,Martin Oeggerli,Bernhard Egger | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEMs) are widely renowned for their ability to analyze the surface structures of microscopic objects, offering the capability to capture highly detailed, yet only grayscale, images. To create more expressive and realistic illustrations, these images are typically manually colorized by an artist with the support of image editing software. This task becomes highly laborious when multiple images of a scanned object require colorization. We propose facilitating this process by using the underlying 3D structure of the microscopic scene to propagate the color information to all the captured images, from as little as one colorized view. We explore several scene representation techniques and achieve high-quality colorized novel view synthesis of a SEM scene. In contrast to prior work, there is no manual intervention or labelling involved in obtaining the 3D representation. This enables an artist to color a single or few views of a sequence and automatically retrieve a fully colored scene or video.

However, most existing models rely on 2D network architectures that lack inherent 3D biases, resulting in compromised geometric consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-in module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusion models. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: for each denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediate multi-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes the rendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through feature addition. We study two variants of 3D-Adapter: a fast feed-forward version based on Gaussian splatting and a versatile training-free version utilizing neural fields and meshes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-Adapter not only greatly enhances the geometry quality of text-to-multi-view models such as Instant3D and Zero123++, but also enables high-quality 3D generation using the plain text-to-image Stable Diffusion.

Despite the promising results achieved by 3DGS, its rendering performance is constrained by its dependence on costly non-commutative alpha-blending operations. These operations mandate complex view dependent sorting operations that introduce computational overhead, especially on the resource-constrained platforms such as mobile phones. In this paper, we propose Weighted Sum Rendering, which approximates alpha blending with weighted sums, thereby removing the need for sorting. This simplifies implementation, delivers superior performance, and eliminates the "popping" artifacts caused by sorting. Experimental results show that optimizing a generalized Gaussian splatting formulation to the new differentiable rendering yields competitive image quality. The method was implemented and tested in a mobile device GPU, achieving on average $1.23\\times$ faster rendering.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18931](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18931) |
| 692 | Dynamic 3D Gaussian Tracking for Graph-Based Neural Dynamics Modeling | Mingtong Zhang,Kaifeng Zhang,Yunzhu Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Videos of robots interacting with objects encode rich information about the objects' dynamics. However, existing video prediction approaches typically do not explicitly account for the 3D information from videos, such as robot actions and objects' 3D states, limiting their use in real-world robotic applications. In this work, we introduce a framework to learn object dynamics directly from multi-view RGB videos by explicitly considering the robot's action trajectories and their effects on scene dynamics. We utilize the 3D Gaussian representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to train a particle-based dynamics model using Graph Neural Networks. This model operates on sparse control particles downsampled from the densely tracked 3D Gaussian reconstructions. By learning the neural dynamics model on offline robot interaction data, our method can predict object motions under varying initial configurations and unseen robot actions. The 3D transformations of Gaussians can be interpolated from the motions of control particles, enabling the rendering of predicted future object states and achieving action-conditioned video prediction. The dynamics model can also be applied to model-based planning frameworks for object manipulation tasks. We conduct experiments on various kinds of deformable materials, including ropes, clothes, and stuffed animals, demonstrating our framework's ability to model complex shapes and dynamics.

| 691 | RNG: Relightable Neural Gaussians | Jiahui Fan,Fujun Luan,Jian Yang,Milo\xc5\xa1 Ha\xc5\xa1an,Beibei Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown its impressive power in novel view synthesis. However, creating relightable 3D assets, especially for objects with ill-defined shapes (e.g., fur), is still a challenging task. For these scenes, the decomposition between the light, geometry, and material is more ambiguous, as neither the surface constraints nor the analytical shading model hold. To address this issue, we propose RNG, a novel representation of relightable neural Gaussians, enabling the relighting of objects with both hard surfaces or fluffy boundaries. We avoid any assumptions in the shading model but maintain feature vectors, which can be further decoded by an MLP into colors, in each Gaussian point. Following prior work, we utilize a point light to reduce the ambiguity and introduce a shadow-aware condition to the network. We additionally propose a depth refinement network to help the shadow computation under the 3DGS framework, leading to better shadow effects under point lights. Furthermore, to avoid the blurriness brought by the alpha-blending in 3DGS, we design a hybrid forward-deferred optimization strategy. As a result, we achieve about $20\\times$ faster in training and about $600\\times$ faster in rendering than prior work based on neural radiance fields, with $60$ frames per second on an RTX4090.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19702](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19702) |

Although current methods based on NeRF have achieved satisfactory performance, they still can not reach real-time levels. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered researchers attention due to their outstanding rendering quality and real-time speed. Therefore, a new paradigm has been proposed: defining a canonical 3D gaussians and deforming it to individual frames in deformable fields. However, since the coordinates of canonical 3D gaussians are filled with noise, which can transfer noise into the deformable fields, and there is currently no method that adequately considers the aggregation of 4D information. Therefore, we propose Denoised Deformable Network with Temporal-Spatial Aggregation for Dynamic Scene Rendering (DN-4DGS). Specifically, a Noise Suppression Strategy is introduced to change the distribution of the coordinates of the canonical 3D gaussians and suppress noise. Additionally, a Decoupled Temporal-Spatial Aggregation Module is designed to aggregate information from adjacent points and frames. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality under a real-time level.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13607](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13607) |
| 689 | VR-Splatting: Foveated Radiance Field Rendering via 3D Gaussian Splatting and Neural Points | Linus Franke,Laura Fink,Marc Stamminger | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS), particularly neural radiance fields (NeRF) and Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have demonstrated impressive results in photorealistic scene rendering. These techniques hold great potential for applications in virtual tourism and teleportation, where immersive realism is crucial. However, the high-performance demands of virtual reality (VR) systems present challenges in directly utilizing even such fast-to-render scene representations like 3DGS due to latency and computational constraints.  In this paper, we propose foveated rendering as a promising solution to these obstacles. We analyze state-of-the-art NVS methods with respect to their rendering performance and compatibility with the human visual system. Our approach introduces a novel foveated rendering approach for Virtual Reality, that leverages the sharp, detailed output of neural point rendering for the foveal region, fused with a smooth rendering of 3DGS for the peripheral vision.  Our evaluation confirms that perceived sharpness and detail-richness are increased by our approach compared to a standard VR-ready 3DGS configuration. Our system meets the necessary performance requirements for real-time VR interactions, ultimately enhancing the user's immersive experience.

| 688 | PLGS: Robust Panoptic Lifting with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Yu Wang,Xiaobao Wei,Ming Lu,Guoliang Kang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Previous methods utilize the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for panoptic lifting, while their training and rendering speed are unsatisfactory. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent technique due to its rapid training and rendering speed. However, unlike NeRF, the conventional 3DGS may not satisfy the basic smoothness assumption as it does not rely on any parameterized structures to render (e.g., MLPs). Consequently, the conventional 3DGS is, in nature, more susceptible to noisy 2D mask supervision. In this paper, we propose a new method called PLGS that enables 3DGS to generate consistent panoptic segmentation masks from noisy 2D segmentation masks while maintaining superior efficiency compared to NeRF-based methods. Specifically, we build a panoptic-aware structured 3D Gaussian model to introduce smoothness and design effective noise reduction strategies. For the semantic field, instead of initialization with structure from motion, we construct reliable semantic anchor points to initialize the 3D Gaussians. We then use these anchor points as smooth regularization during training. Additionally, we present a self-training approach using pseudo labels generated by merging the rendered masks with the noisy masks to enhance the robustness of PLGS. For the instance field, we project the 2D instance masks into 3D space and match them with oriented bounding boxes to generate cross-view consistent instance masks for supervision. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of both segmentation quality and speed.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17505](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17505) |
| 687 | AG-SLAM: Active Gaussian Splatting SLAM | Wen Jiang,Boshu Lei,Katrina Ashton,Kostas Daniilidis | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present AG-SLAM, the first active SLAM system utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for online scene reconstruction. In recent years, radiance field scene representations, including 3DGS have been widely used in SLAM and exploration, but actively planning trajectories for robotic exploration is still unvisited. In particular, many exploration methods assume precise localization and thus do not mitigate the significant risk of constructing a trajectory, which is difficult for a SLAM system to operate on. This can cause camera tracking failure and lead to failures in real-world robotic applications. Our method leverages Fisher Information to balance the dual objectives of maximizing the information gain for the environment while minimizing the cost of localization errors. Experiments conducted on the Gibson and Habitat-Matterport 3D datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results of the proposed method.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17422](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17422) |
| 686 | EF-3DGS: Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3D Gaussian Splatting | Bohao Liao,Wei Zhai,Zengyu Wan,Tianzhu Zhang,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Scene reconstruction from casually captured videos has wide applications in real-world scenarios. With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

Previous methods extending 3DGS to model dynamic scenes have struggled to accurately represent specular surfaces. Our method addresses this limitation by introducing a residual correction technique for accurate surface normal computation during deformation, complemented by a deformable environment map that adapts to time-varying lighting conditions. We implement a coarse-to-fine training strategy that significantly enhances both scene geometry and specular color prediction. We demonstrate that our model outperforms prior methods for view synthesis of scenes containing dynamic specular objects and that it is the only existing 3DGS method capable of synthesizing photorealistic real-world dynamic specular scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering complex, dynamic, and specular scenes.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17249](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17249) |
| 684 | E-3DGS: Gaussian Splatting with Exposure and Motion Events | Xiaoting Yin,Hao Shi,Yuhan Bao,Zhenshan Bing,Yiyi Liao,Kailun Yang,Kaiwei Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Estimating Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from images captured under optimal conditions has been extensively explored in the vision community. However, robotic applications often face challenges such as motion blur, insufficient illumination, and high computational overhead, which adversely affect downstream tasks like navigation, inspection, and scene visualization. To address these challenges, we propose E-3DGS, a novel event-based approach that partitions events into motion (from camera or object movement) and exposure (from camera exposure), using the former to handle fast-motion scenes and using the latter to reconstruct grayscale images for high-quality training and optimization of event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We introduce a novel integration of 3DGS with exposure events for high-quality reconstruction of explicit scene representations. Our versatile framework can operate on motion events alone for 3D reconstruction, enhance quality using exposure events, or adopt a hybrid mode that balances quality and effectiveness by optimizing with initial exposure events followed by high-speed motion events. We also introduce EME-3D, a real-world 3D dataset with exposure events, motion events, camera calibration parameters, and sparse point clouds. Our method is faster and delivers better reconstruction quality than event-based NeRF while being more cost-effective than NeRF methods that combine event and RGB data by using a single event sensor. By combining motion and exposure events, E-3DGS sets a new benchmark for event-based 3D reconstruction with robust performance in challenging conditions and lower hardware demands.

| 683 | Multi-Layer Gaussian Splatting for Immersive Anatomy Visualization | Constantin Kleinbeck,Hannah Schieber,Klaus Engel,Ralf Gutjahr,Daniel Roth | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In medical image visualization, path tracing of volumetric medical data like CT scans produces lifelike three-dimensional visualizations. Immersive VR displays can further enhance the understanding of complex anatomies. Going beyond the diagnostic quality of traditional 2D slices, they enable interactive 3D evaluation of anatomies, supporting medical education and planning. Rendering high-quality visualizations in real-time, however, is computationally intensive and impractical for compute-constrained devices like mobile headsets.  We propose a novel approach utilizing GS to create an efficient but static intermediate representation of CT scans. We introduce a layered GS representation, incrementally including different anatomical structures while minimizing overlap and extending the GS training to remove inactive Gaussians. We further compress the created model with clustering across layers.  Our approach achieves interactive frame rates while preserving anatomical structures, with quality adjustable to the target hardware. Compared to standard GS, our representation retains some of the explorative qualities initially enabled by immersive path tracing. Selective activation and clipping of layers are possible at rendering time, adding a degree of interactivity to otherwise static GS models. This could enable scenarios where high computational demands would otherwise prohibit using path-traced medical volumes.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16978](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16978) |
| 682 | Fully Explicit Dynamic Gaussian Splatting | Junoh Lee,Chang-Yeon Won,Hyunjun Jung,Inhwan Bae,Hae-Gon Jeon | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting has shown fast and high-quality rendering results in static scenes by leveraging dense 3D prior and explicit representations. Unfortunately, the benefits of the prior and representation do not involve novel view synthesis for dynamic motions. Ironically, this is because the main barrier is the reliance on them, which requires increasing training and rendering times to account for dynamic motions. In this paper, we design a Explicit 4D Gaussian Splatting(Ex4DGS). Our key idea is to firstly separate static and dynamic Gaussians during training, and to explicitly sample positions and rotations of the dynamic Gaussians at sparse timestamps. The sampled positions and rotations are then interpolated to represent both spatially and temporally continuous motions of objects in dynamic scenes as well as reducing computational cost. Additionally, we introduce a progressive training scheme and a point-backtracking technique that improves Ex4DGS's convergence. We initially train Ex4DGS using short timestamps and progressively extend timestamps, which makes it work well with a few point clouds. The point-backtracking is used to quantify the cumulative error of each Gaussian over time, enabling the detection and removal of erroneous Gaussians in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments on various scenes demonstrate the state-of-the-art rendering quality from our method, achieving fast rendering of 62 fps on a single 2080Ti GPU.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15629) |
| 681 | 3DGS-Enhancer: Enhancing Unbounded 3D Gaussian Splatting with View-consistent 2D Diffusion Priors | Xi Liu,Chaoyi Zhou,Siyu Huang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel-view synthesis aims to generate novel views of a scene from multiple input images or videos, and recent advancements like 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) have achieved notable success in producing photorealistic renderings with efficient pipelines. However, generating high-quality novel views under challenging settings, such as sparse input views, remains difficult due to insufficient information in under-sampled areas, often resulting in noticeable artifacts. This paper presents 3DGS-Enhancer, a novel pipeline for enhancing the representation quality of 3DGS representations. We leverage 2D video diffusion priors to address the challenging 3D view consistency problem, reformulating it as achieving temporal consistency within a video generation process. 3DGS-Enhancer restores view-consistent latent features of rendered novel views and integrates them with the input views through a spatial-temporal decoder. The enhanced views are then used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model, significantly improving its rendering performance. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets of unbounded scenes demonstrate that 3DGS-Enhancer yields superior reconstruction performance and high-fidelity rendering results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Existing methods for dynamic scenes either fail to update in real-time or rely on additional depth sensors for simple scene editing, limiting their applicability in real-world. In this paper, we introduce MSGField, a representation that uses a collection of 2D Gaussians for high-quality reconstruction, further enhanced with attributes to encode semantic and motion information. Specially, we represent the motion field compactly by decomposing each primitive's motion into a combination of a limited set of motion bases. Leveraging the differentiable real-time rendering of Gaussian splatting, we can quickly optimize object motion, even for complex non-rigid motions, with image supervision from only two camera views. Additionally, we designed a pipeline that utilizes object priors to efficiently obtain well-defined semantics. In our challenging dataset, which includes flexible and extremely small objects, our method achieve a success rate of 79.2% in static and 63.3% in dynamic environments for language-guided manipulation. For specified object grasping, we achieve a success rate of 90%, on par with point cloud-based methods.

In this work, we formulate the compact 3D Gaussian learning as an end-to-end Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) problem and propose RDO-Gaussian that can achieve flexible and continuous rate control. RDO-Gaussian addresses two main issues that exist in current schemes: 1) Different from prior endeavors that minimize the rate under the fixed distortion, we introduce dynamic pruning and entropy-constrained vector quantization (ECVQ) that optimize the rate and distortion at the same time. 2) Previous works treat the colors of each Gaussian equally, while we model the colors of different regions and materials with learnable numbers of parameters. We verify our method on both real and synthetic scenes, showcasing that RDO-Gaussian greatly reduces the size of 3D Gaussian over 40x, and surpasses existing methods in rate-distortion performance.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01597](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01597) |

These scenes are characterized by long and narrow camera trajectories, occlusion, complex object relationships, and data sparsity across multiple scales. Despite recent advancements, existing surface reconstruction methods, which are primarily designed for object-centric scenarios, struggle to adapt effectively to the unique characteristics of street scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce StreetSurfGS, the first method to employ Gaussian Splatting specifically tailored for scalable urban street scene surface reconstruction. StreetSurfGS utilizes a planar-based octree representation and segmented training to reduce memory costs, accommodate unique camera characteristics, and ensure scalability. Additionally, to mitigate depth inaccuracies caused by object overlap, we propose a guided smoothing strategy within regularization to eliminate inaccurate boundary points and outliers. Furthermore, to address sparse views and multi-scale challenges, we use a dual-step matching strategy that leverages adjacent and long-term information.

Compared to frame-based camera, a novel type of bio-inspired visual sensor, i.e. event camera, has demonstrated advantages in high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low power consumption and low latency. Due to its unique asynchronous and irregular data capturing process, limited work has been proposed to apply neural representation or 3D Gaussian splatting for an event camera. In this work, we present IncEventGS, an incremental 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction algorithm with a single event camera. To recover the 3D scene representation incrementally, we exploit the tracking and mapping paradigm of conventional SLAM pipelines for IncEventGS. Given the incoming event stream, the tracker firstly estimates an initial camera motion based on prior reconstructed 3D-GS scene representation. The mapper then jointly refines both the 3D scene representation and camera motion based on the previously estimated motion trajectory from the tracker. The experimental results demonstrate that IncEventGS delivers superior performance compared to prior NeRF-based methods and other related baselines, even we do not have the ground-truth camera poses. Furthermore, our method can also deliver better performance compared to state-of-the-art event visual odometry methods in terms of camera motion estimation.

This paper introduces score-based iterative reconstruction (SIR), an efficient and general algorithm mimicking a differentiable 3D reconstruction process to reduce the NFEs and enable optimization in pixel space. Given a single set of images sampled from a multi-view score-based diffusion model, SIR repeatedly optimizes 3D parameters, unlike the single-step optimization in SDS. With other improvements in training, we present an efficient approach called MicroDreamer that generally applies to various 3D representations and 3D generation tasks. In particular, MicroDreamer is 5-20 times faster than SDS in generating neural radiance field while retaining a comparable performance and takes about 20 seconds to create meshes from 3D Gaussian splatting on a single A100 GPU, halving the time of the fastest optimization-based baseline DreamGaussian with significantly superior performance compared to the measurement standard deviation.

| 673 | Neural Signed Distance Function Inference through Splatting 3D Gaussians Pulled on Zero-Level Set | Wenyuan Zhang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>It is vital to infer a signed distance function (SDF) in multi-view based surface reconstruction. 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) provides a novel perspective for volume rendering, and shows advantages in rendering efficiency and quality. Although 3DGS provides a promising neural rendering option, it is still hard to infer SDFs for surface reconstruction with 3DGS due to the discreteness, the sparseness, and the off-surface drift of 3D Gaussians. To resolve these issues, we propose a method that seamlessly merge 3DGS with the learning of neural SDFs. Our key idea is to more effectively constrain the SDF inference with the multi-view consistency. To this end, we dynamically align 3D Gaussians on the zero-level set of the neural SDF using neural pulling, and then render the aligned 3D Gaussians through the differentiable rasterization. Meanwhile, we update the neural SDF by pulling neighboring space to the pulled 3D Gaussians, which progressively refine the signed distance field near the surface. With both differentiable pulling and splatting, we jointly optimize 3D Gaussians and the neural SDF with both RGB and geometry constraints, which recovers more accurate, smooth, and complete surfaces with more geometry details. Our numerical and visual comparisons show our superiority over the state-of-the-art results on the widely used benchmarks.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14189](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14189) |

However, merely decomposing 4D dynamic scenes into multiple 2D plane-based representations is insufficient for high-fidelity re-rendering of scenes with complex motions. In response, we present DaRePlane, a novel direction-aware representation approach that captures scene dynamics from six different directions. This learned representation undergoes an inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) to recover plane-based information. Within NeRF pipelines, DaRePlane computes features for each space-time point by fusing vectors from these recovered planes, then passed to a tiny MLP for color regression. When applied to Gaussian splatting, DaRePlane computes the features of Gaussian points, followed by a tiny multi-head MLP for spatial-time deformation prediction. Notably, to address redundancy introduced by the six real and six imaginary direction-aware wavelet coefficients, we introduce a trainable masking approach, mitigating storage issues without significant performance decline. To demonstrate the generality and efficiency of DaRePlane, we test it on both regular and surgical dynamic scenes, for both NeRF and GS systems. Extensive experiments show that DaRePlane yields state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for various complex dynamic scenes.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14169](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14169) |

It utilizes a 4D Gaussian representation and a GPU-friendly rasterizer, enabling rapid rendering speeds. Despite its advantages, 4DGS faces significant challenges, notably the requirement of millions of 4D Gaussians, each with extensive associated attributes, leading to substantial memory and storage cost. This paper introduces a memory-efficient framework for 4DGS. We streamline the color attribute by decomposing it into a per-Gaussian direct color component with only 3 parameters and a shared lightweight alternating current color predictor. This approach eliminates the need for spherical harmonics coefficients, which typically involve up to 144 parameters in classic 4DGS, thereby creating a memory-efficient 4D Gaussian representation. Furthermore, we introduce an entropy-constrained Gaussian deformation technique that uses a deformation field to expand the action range of each Gaussian and integrates an opacity-based entropy loss to limit the number of Gaussians, thus forcing our model to use as few Gaussians as possible to fit a dynamic scene well. With simple half-precision storage and zip compression, our framework achieves a storage reduction by approximately 190$\\times$ and 125$\\times$ on the Technicolor and Neural 3D Video datasets, respectively, compared to the original 4DGS. Meanwhile, it maintains comparable rendering speeds and scene representation quality, setting a new standard in the field.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13613](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13613) |
| 668 | GlossyGS: Inverse Rendering of Glossy Objects with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Shuichang Lai,Letian Huang,Jie Guo,Kai Cheng,Bowen Pan,Xiaoxiao Long,Jiangjing Lyu,Chengfei Lv,Yanwen Guo | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing objects from posed images is a crucial and complex task in computer graphics and computer vision. While NeRF-based neural reconstruction methods have exhibited impressive reconstruction ability, they tend to be time-comsuming. Recent strategies have adopted 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) for inverse rendering, which have led to quick and effective outcomes. However, these techniques generally have difficulty in producing believable geometries and materials for glossy objects, a challenge that stems from the inherent ambiguities of inverse rendering. To address this, we introduce GlossyGS, an innovative 3D-GS-based inverse rendering framework that aims to precisely reconstruct the geometry and materials of glossy objects by integrating material priors. The key idea is the use of micro-facet geometry segmentation prior, which helps to reduce the intrinsic ambiguities and improve the decomposition of geometries and materials. Additionally, we introduce a normal map prefiltering strategy to more accurately simulate the normal distribution of reflective surfaces. These strategies are integrated into a hybrid geometry and material representation that employs both explicit and implicit methods to depict glossy objects. We demonstrate through quantitative analysis and qualitative visualization that the proposed method is effective to reconstruct high-fidelity geometries and materials of glossy objects, and performs favorably against state-of-the-arts.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13349](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13349) |
| 667 | Octree-GS: Towards Consistent Real-time Rendering with LOD-Structured 3D Gaussians | Kerui Ren,Lihan Jiang,Tao Lu,Mulin Yu,Linning Xu,Zhangkai Ni,Bo Dai | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The recent 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) has shown remarkable rendering fidelity and efficiency compared to NeRF-based neural scene representations. While demonstrating the potential for real-time rendering, 3D-GS encounters rendering bottlenecks in large scenes with complex details due to an excessive number of Gaussian primitives located within the viewing frustum. This limitation is particularly noticeable in zoom-out views and can lead to inconsistent rendering speeds in scenes with varying details. Moreover, it often struggles to capture the corresponding level of details at different scales with its heuristic density control operation. Inspired by the Level-of-Detail (LOD) techniques, we introduce Octree-GS, featuring an LOD-structured 3D Gaussian approach supporting level-of-detail decomposition for scene representation that contributes to the final rendering results. Our model dynamically selects the appropriate level from the set of multi-resolution anchor points, ensuring consistent rendering performance with adaptive LOD adjustments while maintaining high-fidelity rendering results.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17898](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17898) |
| 666 | Spiking GS: Towards High-Accuracy and Low-Cost Surface Reconstruction via Spiking Neuron-based Gaussian Splatting | Weixing Zhang,Zongrui Li,De Ma,Huajin Tang,Xudong Jiang,Qian Zheng,Gang Pan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting is capable of reconstructing 3D scenes in minutes. Despite recent advances in improving surface reconstruction accuracy, the reconstructed results still exhibit bias and suffer from inefficiency in storage and training. This paper provides a different observation on the cause of the inefficiency and the reconstruction bias, which is attributed to the integration of the low-opacity parts (LOPs) of the generated Gaussians. We show that LOPs consist of Gaussians with overall low-opacity (LOGs) and the low-opacity tails (LOTs) of Gaussians. We propose Spiking GS to reduce such two types of LOPs by integrating spiking neurons into the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. Specifically, we introduce global and local full-precision integrate-and-fire spiking neurons to the opacity and representation function of flattened 3D Gaussians, respectively. Furthermore, we enhance the density control strategy with spiking neurons' thresholds and a new criterion on the scale of Gaussians. Our method can represent more accurate reconstructed surfaces at a lower cost.

| 665 | Gaussian Splatting to Real World Flight Navigation Transfer with Liquid Networks | Alex Quach,Makram Chahine,Alexander Amini,Ramin Hasani,Daniela Rus | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Simulators are powerful tools for autonomous robot learning as they offer scalable data generation, flexible design, and optimization of trajectories. However, transferring behavior learned from simulation data into the real world proves to be difficult, usually mitigated with compute-heavy domain randomization methods or further model fine-tuning. We present a method to improve generalization and robustness to distribution shifts in sim-to-real visual quadrotor navigation tasks. To this end, we first build a simulator by integrating Gaussian Splatting with quadrotor flight dynamics, and then, train robust navigation policies using Liquid neural networks. In this way, we obtain a full-stack imitation learning protocol that combines advances in 3D Gaussian splatting radiance field rendering, crafty programming of expert demonstration training data, and the task understanding capabilities of Liquid networks. Through a series of quantitative flight tests, we demonstrate the robust transfer of navigation skills learned in a single simulation scene directly to the real world. We further show the ability to maintain performance beyond the training environment under drastic distribution and physical environment changes. Our learned Liquid policies, trained on single target manoeuvres curated from a photorealistic simulated indoor flight only, generalize to multi-step hikes onboard a real hardware platform outdoors.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15149](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15149) |

Specifically, our model can process 32 source images at 960x540 resolution within only 1.3 seconds on a single A100 80G GPU. Our architecture features a mixture of the recent Mamba2 blocks and the classical transformer blocks which allowed many more tokens to be processed than prior work, enhanced by efficient token merging and Gaussian pruning steps that balance between quality and efficiency. Unlike previous feed-forward models that are limited to processing 1~4 input images and can only reconstruct a small portion of a large scene, Long-LRM reconstructs the entire scene in a single feed-forward step.

| 663 | Gaussian Primitives for Deformable Image Registration | Jihe Li,Xiang Liu,Fabian Zhang,Xia Li,Xixin Cao,Ye Zhang,Joachim Buhmann | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Deformable Image Registration (DIR) is essential for aligning medical images that exhibit anatomical variations, facilitating applications such as disease tracking and radiotherapy planning. While classical iterative methods and deep learning approaches have achieved success in DIR, they are often hindered by computational inefficiency or poor generalization. In this paper, we introduce GaussianDIR, a novel, case-specific optimization DIR method inspired by 3D Gaussian splatting. In general, GaussianDIR represents image deformations using a sparse set of mobile and flexible Gaussian primitives, each defined by a center position, covariance, and local rigid transformation. This compact and explicit representation reduces noise and computational overhead while improving interpretability. Furthermore, the movement of individual voxel is derived via blending the local rigid transformation of the neighboring Gaussian primitives. By this, GaussianDIR captures both global smoothness and local rigidity as well as reduces the computational burden. To address varying levels of deformation complexity, GaussianDIR also integrates an adaptive density control mechanism that dynamically adjusts the density of Gaussian primitives. Additionally, we employ multi-scale Gaussian primitives to capture both coarse and fine deformations, reducing optimization to local minima. Experimental results on brain MRI, lung CT, and cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate that GaussianDIR outperforms existing DIR methods in both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its potential for clinical applications. Finally, as a training-free approach, it challenges the stereotype that iterative methods are inherently slow and transcend the limitations of poor generalization.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03394](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03394) |

While previous Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) representation have been prevalent for its implicit, coordinate-based model, the recent emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable potential in its explicit radiance field representation. By leveraging 3D Gaussian primitives for explicit scene representation and enabling differentiable rendering, 3DGS has shown significant advantages over other radiance fields in real-time rendering and photo-realistic performance, which is beneficial for robotic applications. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive understanding of 3DGS in the field of robotics.

| 660 | SplatPose+: Real-time Image-Based Pose-Agnostic 3D Anomaly Detection | Yizhe Liu,Yan Song Hu,Yuhao Chen,John Zelek | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Image-based Pose-Agnostic 3D Anomaly Detection is an important task that has emerged in industrial quality control. This task seeks to find anomalies from query images of a tested object given a set of reference images of an anomaly-free object. The challenge is that the query views (a.k.a poses) are unknown and can be different from the reference views. Currently, new methods such as OmniposeAD and SplatPose have emerged to bridge the gap by synthesizing pseudo reference images at the query views for pixel-to-pixel comparison. However, none of these methods can infer in real-time, which is critical in industrial quality control for massive production. For this reason, we propose SplatPose+, which employs a hybrid representation consisting of a Structure from Motion (SfM) model for localization and a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model for Novel View Synthesis. Although our proposed pipeline requires the computation of an additional SfM model, it offers real-time inference speeds and faster training compared to SplatPose. Quality-wise, we achieved a new SOTA on the Pose-agnostic Anomaly Detection benchmark with the Multi-Pose Anomaly Detection (MAD-SIM) dataset.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12080](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12080) |
| 659 | Dual-frame Fluid Motion Estimation with Test-time Optimization and Zero-divergence Loss | Yifei Zhang,Huan-ang Gao,Zhou Jiang,Hao Zhao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) is a key technique for analyzing turbulent flow, one of the most challenging computational problems of our century. At the core of 3D PTV is the dual-frame fluid motion estimation algorithm, which tracks particles across two consecutive frames. Recently, deep learning-based methods have achieved impressive accuracy in dual-frame fluid motion estimation; however, they heavily depend on large volumes of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce a new method that is completely self-supervised and notably outperforms its fully-supervised counterparts while requiring only 1% of the training samples (without labels) used by previous methods. Our method features a novel zero-divergence loss that is specific to the domain of turbulent flow. Inspired by the success of splat operation in high-dimensional filtering and random fields, we propose a splat-based implementation for this loss which is both efficient and effective. The self-supervised nature of our method naturally supports test-time optimization, leading to the development of a tailored Dynamic Velocimetry Enhancer (DVE) module. We demonstrate that strong cross-domain robustness is achieved through test-time optimization on unseen leave-one-out synthetic domains and real physical/biological domains.

This novel representation allows high-quality novel view synthesis. During the mapping phase, structure-from-motion (SfM) is applied first, followed by the generation of a GS map. During localization, the initial position is obtained through image retrieval, local feature matching coupled with a PnP solver, and then a high-precision pose is achieved through the analysis-by-synthesis manner on the GS map.

To describe complex appearance, we employ a Lambertian plus a mixture of angular Gaussians as an effective reflectance function for each spatial Gaussian. To generate self-shadow, we splat all spatial Gaussians towards the light source to obtain shadow values, which are further refined by a small multi-layer perceptron. To compensate for other effects like global illumination, another network is trained to compute and add a per-spatial-Gaussian RGB tuple. The effectiveness of our representation is demonstrated on 30 samples with a wide variation in geometry (from solid to fluffy) and appearance (from translucent to anisotropic), as well as using different forms of input data, including rendered images of synthetic/reconstructed objects, photographs captured with a handheld camera and a flash, or from a professional lightstage. We achieve a training time of 40-70 minutes and a rendering speed of 90 fps on a single commodity GPU. Our results compare favorably with state-of-the-art techniques in terms of quality/performance.

| 655 | MCGS: Multiview Consistency Enhancement for Sparse-View 3D Gaussian Radiance Fields | Yuru Xiao,Deming Zhai,Wenbo Zhao,Kui Jiang,Junjun Jiang,Xianming Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Radiance fields represented by 3D Gaussians excel at synthesizing novel views, offering both high training efficiency and fast rendering. However, with sparse input views, the lack of multi-view consistency constraints results in poorly initialized point clouds and unreliable heuristics for optimization and densification, leading to suboptimal performance. Existing methods often incorporate depth priors from dense estimation networks but overlook the inherent multi-view consistency in input images. Additionally, they rely on multi-view stereo (MVS)-based initialization, which limits the efficiency of scene representation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, named MCGS, enabling photorealistic scene reconstruction from sparse input views. The key innovations of MCGS in enhancing multi-view consistency are as follows: i) We introduce an initialization method by leveraging a sparse matcher combined with a random filling strategy, yielding a compact yet sufficient set of initial points. This approach enhances the initial geometry prior, promoting efficient scene representation. ii) We develop a multi-view consistency-guided progressive pruning strategy to refine the Gaussian field by strengthening consistency and eliminating low-contribution Gaussians. These modular, plug-and-play strategies enhance robustness to sparse input views, accelerate rendering, and reduce memory consumption, making MCGS a practical and efficient framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11394](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11394) |
| 654 | Spectral-GS: Taming 3D Gaussian Splatting with Spectral Entropy | Letian Huang,Jie Guo,Jialin Dan,Ruoyu Fu,Shujie Wang,Yuanqi Li,Yanwen Guo | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis, demonstrating high fidelity and efficiency. However, it easily exhibits needle-like artifacts, especially when increasing the sampling rate. Mip-Splatting tries to remove these artifacts with a 3D smoothing filter for frequency constraints and a 2D Mip filter for approximated supersampling. Unfortunately, it tends to produce over-blurred results, and sometimes needle-like Gaussians still persist. Our spectral analysis of the covariance matrix during optimization and densification reveals that current 3D-GS lacks shape awareness, relying instead on spectral radius and view positional gradients to determine splitting. As a result, needle-like Gaussians with small positional gradients and low spectral entropy fail to split and overfit high-frequency details. Furthermore, both the filters used in 3D-GS and Mip-Splatting reduce the spectral entropy and increase the condition number during zooming in to synthesize novel view, causing view inconsistencies and more pronounced artifacts. Our Spectral-GS, based on spectral analysis, introduces 3D shape-aware splitting and 2D view-consistent filtering strategies, effectively addressing these issues, enhancing 3D-GS's capability to represent high-frequency details without noticeable artifacts, and achieving high-quality photorealistic rendering.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12771](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12771) |

However, current methods face challenges such as sensitivity to artifacts and noise, sub-optimal selection of training viewpoints, and a lack of light global optimization. In this paper, we propose a dense SLAM system that tightly couples 3DGS with ORB features. We design a joint optimization approach for robust tracking and effectively reducing the impact of noise and artifacts. This involves combining novel geometric observations, derived from accumulated transmittance, with ORB features extracted from pixel data. Furthermore, to improve mapping quality, we propose an adaptive Gaussian expansion and regularization method that enables Gaussian primitives to represent the scene compactly. This is coupled with a viewpoint selection strategy based on the hybrid graph to mitigate over-fitting effects and enhance convergence quality. Finally, our approach achieves compact and high-quality scene representations and accurate localization. GSORB-SLAM has been evaluated on different datasets, demonstrating outstanding performance.

| 652 | Scalable Indoor Novel-View Synthesis using Drone-Captured 360 Imagery with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Yuanbo Chen,Chengyu Zhang,Jason Wang,Xuefan Gao,Avideh Zakhor | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Scene reconstruction and novel-view synthesis for large, complex, multi-story, indoor scenes is a challenging and time-consuming task. Prior methods have utilized drones for data capture and radiance fields for scene reconstruction, both of which present certain challenges. First, in order to capture diverse viewpoints with the drone's front-facing camera, some approaches fly the drone in an unstable zig-zag fashion, which hinders drone-piloting and generates motion blur in the captured data. Secondly, most radiance field methods do not easily scale to arbitrarily large number of images. This paper proposes an efficient and scalable pipeline for indoor novel-view synthesis from drone-captured 360 videos using 3D Gaussian Splatting. 360 cameras capture a wide set of viewpoints, allowing for comprehensive scene capture under a simple straightforward drone trajectory. To scale our method to large scenes, we devise a divide-and-conquer strategy to automatically split the scene into smaller blocks that can be reconstructed individually and in parallel. We also propose a coarse-to-fine alignment strategy to seamlessly match these blocks together to compose the entire scene. Our experiments demonstrate marked improvement in both reconstruction quality, i.e. PSNR and SSIM, and computation time compared to prior approaches.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11285](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11285) |
| 651 | Few-shot Novel View Synthesis using Depth Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting | Raja Kumar,Vanshika Vats | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian splatting has surpassed neural radiance field methods in novel view synthesis by achieving lower computational costs and real-time high-quality rendering. Although it produces a high-quality rendering with a lot of input views, its performance drops significantly when only a few views are available. In this work, we address this by proposing a depth-aware Gaussian splatting method for few-shot novel view synthesis. We use monocular depth prediction as a prior, along with a scale-invariant depth loss, to constrain the 3D shape under just a few input views. We also model color using lower-order spherical harmonics to avoid overfitting. Further, we observe that removing splats with lower opacity periodically, as performed in the original work, leads to a very sparse point cloud and, hence, a lower-quality rendering. To mitigate this, we retain all the splats, leading to a better reconstruction in a few view settings. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the traditional 3D Gaussian splatting methods by achieving improvements of 10.5% in peak signal-to-noise ratio, 6% in structural similarity index, and 14.1% in perceptual similarity, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach.

However, most existing methods generate single-view images using generative models and then stitch them together in 3D space. This independent generation for each view often results in spatial inconsistency and implausibility in the 3D scenes. To address this challenge, we proposed a novel text-driven 3D-consistent scene generation model: SceneDreamer360. Our proposed method leverages a text-driven panoramic image generation model as a prior for 3D scene generation and employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to ensure consistency across multi-view panoramic images. Specifically, SceneDreamer360 enhances the fine-tuned Panfusion generator with a three-stage panoramic enhancement, enabling the generation of high-resolution, detail-rich panoramic images. During the 3D scene construction, a novel point cloud fusion initialization method is used, producing higher quality and spatially consistent point clouds. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to other methods, SceneDreamer360 with its panoramic image generation and 3DGS can produce higher quality, spatially consistent, and visually appealing 3D scenes from any text prompt.

Metzler | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>By combining differentiable rendering with explicit point-based scene representations, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated breakthrough 3D reconstruction capabilities. However, to date 3DGS has had limited impact on robotics, where high-speed egomotion is pervasive: Egomotion introduces motion blur and leads to artifacts in existing frame-based 3DGS reconstruction methods. To address this challenge, we introduce Event3DGS, an {\\em event-based} 3DGS framework. By exploiting the exceptional temporal resolution of event cameras, Event3GDS can reconstruct high-fidelity 3D structure and appearance under high-speed egomotion. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Event3DGS compared with existing event-based dense 3D scene reconstruction frameworks; Event3DGS substantially improves reconstruction quality (+3dB) while reducing computational costs by 95\\%.

| 647 | GSDF: 3DGS Meets SDF for Improved Rendering and Reconstruction | Mulin Yu,Tao Lu,Linning Xu,Lihan Jiang,Yuanbo Xiangli,Bo Dai | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Presenting a 3D scene from multiview images remains a core and long-standing challenge in computer vision and computer graphics. Two main requirements lie in rendering and reconstruction. Notably, SOTA rendering quality is usually achieved with neural volumetric rendering techniques, which rely on aggregated point/primitive-wise color and neglect the underlying scene geometry. Learning of neural implicit surfaces is sparked from the success of neural rendering. Current works either constrain the distribution of density fields or the shape of primitives, resulting in degraded rendering quality and flaws on the learned scene surfaces. The efficacy of such methods is limited by the inherent constraints of the chosen neural representation, which struggles to capture fine surface details, especially for larger, more intricate scenes. To address these issues, we introduce GSDF, a novel dual-branch architecture that combines the benefits of a flexible and efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation with neural Signed Distance Fields (SDF). The core idea is to leverage and enhance the strengths of each branch while alleviating their limitation through mutual guidance and joint supervision. We show on diverse scenes that our design unlocks the potential for more accurate and detailed surface reconstructions, and at the meantime benefits 3DGS rendering with structures that are more aligned with the underlying geometry.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16964](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16964) |
| 646 | Gaussian Splatting Visual MPC for Granular Media Manipulation | Wei-Cheng Tseng,Ellina Zhang,Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula,Florian Shkurti | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in learned 3D representations have enabled significant progress in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks, particularly for rigid-body objects. However, manipulating granular materials such as beans, nuts, and rice, remains challenging due to the intricate physics of particle interactions, high-dimensional and partially observable state, inability to visually track individual particles in a pile, and the computational demands of accurate dynamics prediction. Current deep latent dynamics models often struggle to generalize in granular material manipulation due to a lack of inductive biases. In this work, we propose a novel approach that learns a visual dynamics model over Gaussian splatting representations of scenes and leverages this model for manipulating granular media via Model-Predictive Control. Our method enables efficient optimization for complex manipulation tasks on piles of granular media. We evaluate our approach in both simulated and real-world settings, demonstrating its ability to solve unseen planning tasks and generalize to new environments in a zero-shot transfer. We also show significant prediction and manipulation performance improvements compared to existing granular media manipulation methods.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09740](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09740) |

Accurately reconstructing an object's complete 3D structure and texture has numerous applications in real-world scenarios, including robotic manipulation, grasping, 3D scene understanding, and AR/VR. Recent advancements in 3D object generation have introduced techniques that reconstruct an object's 3D shape and texture by optimizing the efficient representation of Gaussian Splatting, guided by pre-trained 2D or 3D diffusion models. However, a notable disparity exists between the training datasets of these models, leading to distinct differences in their outputs. While 2D models generate highly detailed visuals, they lack cross-view consistency in geometry and texture. In contrast, 3D models ensure consistency across different views but often result in overly smooth textures. We propose bridging the gap between 2D and 3D diffusion models to address this limitation by integrating a two-stage frequency-based distillation loss with Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, we leverage geometric priors in the low-frequency spectrum from a 3D diffusion model to maintain consistent geometry and use a 2D diffusion model to refine the fidelity and texture in the high-frequency spectrum of the generated 3D structure, resulting in more detailed and fine-grained outcomes. Our approach enhances geometric consistency and visual quality, outperforming the current SOTA. Additionally, we demonstrate the easy adaptability of our method for efficient object pose estimation and tracking.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09467](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09467) |

In this paper, we introduce MagicDrive3D, a novel pipeline for controllable 3D street scene generation that supports multi-condition control, including BEV maps, 3D objects, and text descriptions. Unlike previous methods that reconstruct before training the generative models, MagicDrive3D first trains a video generation model and then reconstructs from the generated data. This innovative approach enables easily controllable generation and static scene acquisition, resulting in high-quality scene reconstruction. To address the minor errors in generated content, we propose deformable Gaussian splatting with monocular depth initialization and appearance modeling to manage exposure discrepancies across viewpoints. Validated on the nuScenes dataset, MagicDrive3D generates diverse, high-quality 3D driving scenes that support any-view rendering and enhance downstream tasks like BEV segmentation. Our results demonstrate the framework's superior performance, showcasing its transformative potential for autonomous driving simulation and beyond.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14475](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14475) |

Elson,Baoru Huang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Accurate 3D reconstruction of dynamic surgical scenes from endoscopic video is essential for robotic-assisted surgery. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise in achieving high-quality reconstructions with fast rendering speeds, their use of inverse depth loss functions compresses depth variations. This can lead to a loss of fine geometric details, limiting their ability to capture precise 3D geometry and effectiveness in intraoperative application. To address these challenges, we present SurgicalGS, a dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting framework specifically designed for surgical scene reconstruction with improved geometric accuracy. Our approach first initialises a Gaussian point cloud using depth priors, employing binary motion masks to identify pixels with significant depth variations and fusing point clouds from depth maps across frames for initialisation. We use the Flexible Deformation Model to represent dynamic scene and introduce a normalised depth regularisation loss along with an unsupervised depth smoothness constraint to ensure more accurate geometric reconstruction. Extensive experiments on two real surgical datasets demonstrate that SurgicalGS achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, especially in terms of accurate geometry, advancing the usability of 3D Gaussian Splatting in robotic-assisted surgery.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09292](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09292) |

Marina | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>View synthesis using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) has demonstrated impressive fidelity in rendering real-world scenarios. However, practical methods for accurate and efficient epistemic Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in view synthesis are lacking. Existing approaches for NeRF either introduce significant computational overhead (e.g., ``10x increase in training time" or ``10x repeated training") or are limited to specific uncertainty conditions or models. Notably, GS models lack any systematic approach for comprehensive epistemic UQ. This capability is crucial for improving the robustness and scalability of neural view synthesis, enabling active model updates, error estimation, and scalable ensemble modeling based on uncertainty. In this paper, we revisit NeRF and GS-based methods from a function approximation perspective, identifying key differences and connections in 3D representation learning. Building on these insights, we introduce PH-Dropout (Post hoc Dropout), the first real-time and accurate method for epistemic uncertainty estimation that operates directly on pre-trained NeRF and GS models. Extensive evaluations validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of PH-Dropout.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05468](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05468) |
| 641 | MeshGS: Adaptive Mesh-Aligned Gaussian Splatting for High-Quality Rendering | Jaehoon Choi,Yonghan Lee,Hyungtae Lee,Heesung Kwon,Dinesh Manocha | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has gained attention for its capability to generate high-fidelity rendering results. At the same time, most applications such as games, animation, and AR/VR use mesh-based representations to represent and render 3D scenes. We propose a novel approach that integrates mesh representation with 3D Gaussian splats to perform high-quality rendering of reconstructed real-world scenes. In particular, we introduce a distance-based Gaussian splatting technique to align the Gaussian splats with the mesh surface and remove redundant Gaussian splats that do not contribute to the rendering. We consider the distance between each Gaussian splat and the mesh surface to distinguish between tightly-bound and loosely-bound Gaussian splats. The tightly-bound splats are flattened and aligned well with the mesh geometry. The loosely-bound Gaussian splats are used to account for the artifacts in reconstructed 3D meshes in terms of rendering. We present a training strategy of binding Gaussian splats to the mesh geometry, and take into account both types of splats. In this context, we introduce several regularization techniques aimed at precisely aligning tightly-bound Gaussian splats with the mesh surface during the training process. We validate the effectiveness of our method on large and unbounded scene from mip-NeRF 360 and Deep Blending datasets. Our method surpasses recent mesh-based neural rendering techniques by achieving a 2dB higher PSNR, and outperforms mesh-based Gaussian splatting methods by 1.3 dB PSNR, particularly on the outdoor mip-NeRF 360 dataset, demonstrating better rendering quality. We provide analyses for each type of Gaussian splat and achieve a reduction in the number of Gaussian splats by 30% compared to the original 3D Gaussian splatting.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08941](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08941) |
| 640 | Fast Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression | Yihang Chen,Qianyi Wu,Mengyao Li,Weiyao Lin,Mehrtash Harandi,Jianfei Cai | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>With 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) advancing real-time and high-fidelity rendering for novel view synthesis, storage requirements pose challenges for their widespread adoption. Although various compression techniques have been proposed, previous art suffers from a common limitation: for any existing 3DGS, per-scene optimization is needed to achieve compression, making the compression sluggish and slow. To address this issue, we introduce Fast Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting (FCGS), an optimization-free model that can compress 3DGS representations rapidly in a single feed-forward pass, which significantly reduces compression time from minutes to seconds. To enhance compression efficiency, we propose a multi-path entropy module that assigns Gaussian attributes to different entropy constraint paths for balance between size and fidelity. We also carefully design both inter- and intra-Gaussian context models to remove redundancies among the unstructured Gaussian blobs. Overall, FCGS achieves a compression ratio of over 20X while maintaining fidelity, surpassing most per-scene SOTA optimization-based methods.

| 639 | Learning Interaction-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting for One-shot Hand Avatars | Xuan Huang,Hanhui Li,Wanquan Liu,Xiaodan Liang,Yiqiang Yan,Yuhao Cheng,Chengqiang Gao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we propose to create animatable avatars for interacting hands with 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and single-image inputs. Existing GS-based methods designed for single subjects often yield unsatisfactory results due to limited input views, various hand poses, and occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage interaction-aware GS framework that exploits cross-subject hand priors and refines 3D Gaussians in interacting areas. Particularly, to handle hand variations, we disentangle the 3D presentation of hands into optimization-based identity maps and learning-based latent geometric features and neural texture maps. Learning-based features are captured by trained networks to provide reliable priors for poses, shapes, and textures, while optimization-based identity maps enable efficient one-shot fitting of out-of-distribution hands. Furthermore, we devise an interaction-aware attention module and a self-adaptive Gaussian refinement module. These modules enhance image rendering quality in areas with intra- and inter-hand interactions, overcoming the limitations of existing GS-based methods. Our proposed method is validated via extensive experiments on the large-scale InterHand2.6M dataset, and it significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance in image quality.

| 638 | Look Gauss, No Pose: Novel View Synthesis using Gaussian Splatting without Accurate Pose Initialization | Christian Schmidt,Jens Piekenbrinck,Bastian Leibe | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as a powerful tool for fast and accurate novel-view synthesis from a set of posed input images. However, like most novel-view synthesis approaches, it relies on accurate camera pose information, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios where acquiring accurate camera poses can be challenging or even impossible. We propose an extension to the 3D Gaussian Splatting framework by optimizing the extrinsic camera parameters with respect to photometric residuals. We derive the analytical gradients and integrate their computation with the existing high-performance CUDA implementation. This enables downstream tasks such as 6-DoF camera pose estimation as well as joint reconstruction and camera refinement. In particular, we achieve rapid convergence and high accuracy for pose estimation on real-world scenes. Our method enables fast reconstruction of 3D scenes without requiring accurate pose information by jointly optimizing geometry and camera poses, while achieving state-of-the-art results in novel-view synthesis. Our approach is considerably faster to optimize than most competing methods, and several times faster in rendering. We show results on real-world scenes and complex trajectories through simulated environments, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLFF while reducing runtime by two to four times compared to the most efficient competing method.

| 637 | Tetrahedron Splatting for 3D Generation | Chun Gu,Zeyu Yang,Zijie Pan,Xiatian Zhu,Li Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D representation is essential to the significant advance of 3D generation with 2D diffusion priors. As a flexible representation, NeRF has been first adopted for 3D representation. With density-based volumetric rendering, it however suffers both intensive computational overhead and inaccurate mesh extraction. Using a signed distance field and Marching Tetrahedra, DMTet allows for precise mesh extraction and real-time rendering but is limited in handling large topological changes in meshes, leading to optimization challenges. Alternatively, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is favored in both training and rendering efficiency while falling short in mesh extraction. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D representation, Tetrahedron Splatting (TeT-Splatting), that supports easy convergence during optimization, precise mesh extraction, and real-time rendering simultaneously. This is achieved by integrating surface-based volumetric rendering within a structured tetrahedral grid while preserving the desired ability of precise mesh extraction, and a tile-based differentiable tetrahedron rasterizer. Furthermore, we incorporate eikonal and normal consistency regularization terms for the signed distance field to improve generation quality and stability. Critically, our representation can be trained without mesh extraction, making the optimization process easier to converge. Our TeT-Splatting can be readily integrated in existing 3D generation pipelines, along with polygonal mesh for texture optimization. Extensive experiments show that our TeT-Splatting strikes a superior tradeoff among convergence speed, render efficiency, and mesh quality as compared to previous alternatives under varying 3D generation settings.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01579](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01579) |

Emulating this capability, we introduce FusionSense, a novel 3D reconstruction framework that enables robots to fuse priors from foundation models with highly sparse observations from vision and tactile sensors. FusionSense addresses three key challenges: (i) How can robots efficiently acquire robust global shape information about the surrounding scene and objects? (ii) How can robots strategically select touch points on the object using geometric and common-sense priors? (iii) How can partial observations such as tactile signals improve the overall representation of the object? Our framework employs 3D Gaussian Splatting as a core representation and incorporates a hierarchical optimization strategy involving global structure construction, object visual hull pruning and local geometric constraints. This advancement results in fast and robust perception in environments with traditionally challenging objects that are transparent, reflective, or dark, enabling more downstream manipulation or navigation tasks.

However, in this work, we reveal a significant security vulnerability that has been largely overlooked in 3DGS: the computation cost of training 3DGS could be maliciously tampered by poisoning the input data. By developing an attack named Poison-splat, we reveal a novel attack surface where the adversary can poison the input images to drastically increase the computation memory and time needed for 3DGS training, pushing the algorithm towards its worst computation complexity. In extreme cases, the attack can even consume all allocable memory, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) that disrupts servers, resulting in practical damages to real-world 3DGS service vendors. Such a computation cost attack is achieved by addressing a bi-level optimization problem through three tailored strategies: attack objective approximation, proxy model rendering, and optional constrained optimization. These strategies not only ensure the effectiveness of our attack but also make it difficult to defend with simple defensive measures. We hope the revelation of this novel attack surface can spark attention to this crucial yet overlooked vulnerability of 3DGS systems.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08190](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08190) |

Our framework includes spatially-aligned conditioning of flat-lit captures and random noise, along with integrated lighting information for global control, utilizing prior knowledge from the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. This model is then applied to dynamic facial performances captured in a consistent flat-lit environment and reconstructed for novel-view synthesis using a scalable dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting method to maintain quality and consistency in the relit results. In addition, we introduce unified lighting control by integrating a novel area lighting representation with directional lighting, allowing for joint adjustments in light size and direction. We also enable high dynamic range imaging (HDRI) composition using multiple directional lights to produce dynamic sequences under complex lighting conditions. Our evaluations demonstrate the models efficiency in achieving precise lighting control and generalizing across various facial expressions while preserving detailed features such as skintexture andhair.

However, achieving high quality without compromising real-time rendering remains challenging, particularly for physically-based ray tracing with view-dependent effects. Recently, N-dimensional Gaussians (N-DG) introduced a 6D spatial-angular representation to better incorporate view-dependent effects, but the Gaussian representation and control scheme are sub-optimal. In this paper, we revisit 6D Gaussians and introduce 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS), which enhances color and opacity representations and leverages the additional directional information in the 6D space for optimized Gaussian control. Our approach is fully compatible with the 3DGS framework and significantly improves real-time radiance field rendering by better modeling view-dependent effects and fine details.

In these applications, coherence across camera frames and multiple views is crucial, be it for robust convergence of a scene reconstruction or for artifact-free fly-throughs. Recent work started mitigating artifacts that break multi-view coherence, including popping artifacts due to inconsistent transparency sorting and perspective-correct outlines of (2D) splats. At the same time, real-time requirements forced such implementations to accept compromises in how transparency of large assemblies of 3D Gaussians is resolved, in turn breaking coherence in other ways. In our work, we aim at achieving maximum coherence, by rendering fully perspective-correct 3D Gaussians while using a high-quality approximation of accurate blending, hybrid transparency, on a per-pixel level, in order to retain real-time frame rates. Our fast and perspectively accurate approach for evaluation of 3D Gaussians does not require matrix inversions, thereby ensuring numerical stability and eliminating the need for special handling of degenerate splats, and the hybrid transparency formulation for blending maintains similar quality as fully resolved per-pixel transparencies at a fraction of the rendering costs. We further show that each of these two components can be independently integrated into Gaussian splatting systems. In combination, they achieve up to 2$\\times$ higher frame rates, 2$\\times$ faster optimization, and equal or better image quality with fewer rendering artifacts compared to traditional 3DGS on common benchmarks.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08129](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08129) |

Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has provided new insights into this problem. Although subsequent efforts rapidly extend static 3D Gaussian to dynamic scenes, they often lack explicit constraints on object motion, leading to optimization difficulties and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose a novel deformable 3D Gaussian splatting framework called MotionGS, which explores explicit motion priors to guide the deformation of 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we first introduce an optical flow decoupling module that decouples optical flow into camera flow and motion flow, corresponding to camera movement and object motion respectively. Then the motion flow can effectively constrain the deformation of 3D Gaussians, thus simulating the motion of dynamic objects. Additionally, a camera pose refinement module is proposed to alternately optimize 3D Gaussians and camera poses, mitigating the impact of inaccurate camera poses.

| 628 | EvGGS: A Collaborative Learning Framework for Event-based Generalizable Gaussian Splatting | Jiaxu Wang,Junhao He,Ziyi Zhang,Mingyuan Sun,Jingkai Sun,Renjing Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Event cameras offer promising advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, making them well-suited for challenging lighting conditions and fast-moving scenarios. However, reconstructing 3D scenes from raw event streams is difficult because event data is sparse and does not carry absolute color information. To release its potential in 3D reconstruction, we propose the first event-based generalizable 3D reconstruction framework, called EvGGS, which reconstructs scenes as 3D Gaussians from only event input in a feedforward manner and can generalize to unseen cases without any retraining. This framework includes a depth estimation module, an intensity reconstruction module, and a Gaussian regression module. These submodules connect in a cascading manner, and we collaboratively train them with a designed joint loss to make them mutually promote. To facilitate related studies, we build a novel event-based 3D dataset with various material objects and calibrated labels of grayscale images, depth maps, camera poses, and silhouettes. Experiments show models that have jointly trained significantly outperform those trained individually. Our approach performs better than all baselines in reconstruction quality, and depth/intensity predictions with satisfactory rendering speed.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14959](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14959) |

Freeman,Kai Zhang,Fujun Luan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose RelitLRM, a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for generating high-quality Gaussian splatting representations of 3D objects under novel illuminations from sparse (4-8) posed images captured under unknown static lighting. Unlike prior inverse rendering methods requiring dense captures and slow optimization, often causing artifacts like incorrect highlights or shadow baking, RelitLRM adopts a feed-forward transformer-based model with a novel combination of a geometry reconstructor and a relightable appearance generator based on diffusion. The model is trained end-to-end on synthetic multi-view renderings of objects under varying known illuminations. This architecture design enables to effectively decompose geometry and appearance, resolve the ambiguity between material and lighting, and capture the multi-modal distribution of shadows and specularity in the relit appearance. We show our sparse-view feed-forward RelitLRM offers competitive relighting results to state-of-the-art dense-view optimization-based baselines while being significantly faster.

| 626 | 3D Vision-Language Gaussian Splatting | Qucheng Peng,Benjamin Planche,Zhongpai Gao,Meng Zheng,Anwesa Choudhuri,Terrence Chen,Chen Chen,Ziyan Wu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models have propelled the development of multi-modal 3D scene understanding, which has vital applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality. However, current multi-modal scene understanding approaches have naively embedded semantic representations into 3D reconstruction methods without striking a balance between visual and language modalities, which leads to unsatisfying semantic rasterization of translucent or reflective objects, as well as over-fitting on color modality. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a solution that adequately handles the distinct visual and semantic modalities, i.e., a 3D vision-language Gaussian splatting model for scene understanding, to put emphasis on the representation learning of language modality. We propose a novel cross-modal rasterizer, using modality fusion along with a smoothed semantic indicator for enhancing semantic rasterization. We also employ a camera-view blending technique to improve semantic consistency between existing and synthesized views, thereby effectively mitigating over-fitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07577](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07577) |

Most existing methods render particles via rasterization, projecting them to screen space tiles for processing in a sorted order. This work instead considers ray tracing the particles, building a bounding volume hierarchy and casting a ray for each pixel using high-performance GPU ray tracing hardware. To efficiently handle large numbers of semi-transparent particles, we describe a specialized rendering algorithm which encapsulates particles with bounding meshes to leverage fast ray-triangle intersections, and shades batches of intersections in depth-order. The benefits of ray tracing are well-known in computer graphics: processing incoherent rays for secondary lighting effects such as shadows and reflections, rendering from highly-distorted cameras common in robotics, stochastically sampling rays, and more. With our renderer, this flexibility comes at little cost compared to rasterization. Experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our approach, as well as several applications in computer graphics and vision. We further propose related improvements to the basic Gaussian representation, including a simple use of generalized kernel functions which significantly reduces particle hit counts.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07090](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07090) |

High-quality and real-time reconstruction enhances situational awareness and is crucial for intelligent robotics. Traditional methods often struggle with poor scene representation or are too slow for real-time use. Inspired by the efficacy of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), we propose a hierarchical planning framework for fast and high-fidelity active reconstruction. Our method evaluates completion and quality gain to adaptively guide reconstruction, integrating global and local planning for efficiency.

The proposed method relies on learning the trade-off between the use of Gaussian splatting and a textured mesh for efficient and high fidelity rendering. We demonstrate its efficiency to animate and render full-body human avatars controlled via the SMPL-X parametric model. Our model learns to apply Gaussian splatting only in areas of the SMPL-X mesh where it is necessary, like hair and out-of-mesh clothing. This results in a minimal number of Gaussians being used to represent the full avatar, and reduced rendering artifacts. This allows us to handle the animation of small body parts such as fingers that are traditionally disregarded. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two open datasets: SnapshotPeople and X-Humans. Our method demonstrates on par reconstruction quality to the state-of-the-art on SnapshotPeople, while using less than a third of Gaussians. HAHA outperforms previous state-of-the-art on novel poses from X-Humans both quantitatively and qualitatively.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01053](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01053) |
| 622 | StopThePop: Sorted Gaussian Splatting for View-Consistent Real-time Rendering | Lukas Radl,Michael Steiner,Mathias Parger,Alexander Weinrauch,Bernhard Kerbl,Markus Steinberger | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a prominent model for constructing 3D representations from images across diverse domains. However, the efficiency of the 3D Gaussian Splatting rendering pipeline relies on several simplifications. Notably, reducing Gaussian to 2D splats with a single view-space depth introduces popping and blending artifacts during view rotation. Addressing this issue requires accurate per-pixel depth computation, yet a full per-pixel sort proves excessively costly compared to a global sort operation. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical rasterization approach that systematically resorts and culls splats with minimal processing overhead. Our software rasterizer effectively eliminates popping artifacts and view inconsistencies, as demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative measurements. Simultaneously, our method mitigates the potential for cheating view-dependent effects with popping, ensuring a more authentic representation. Despite the elimination of cheating, our approach achieves comparable quantitative results for test images, while increasing the consistency for novel view synthesis in motion. Due to its design, our hierarchical approach is only 4% slower on average than the original Gaussian Splatting. Notably, enforcing consistency enables a reduction in the number of Gaussians by approximately half with nearly identical quality and view-consistency. Consequently, rendering performance is nearly doubled, making our approach 1.6x faster than the original Gaussian Splatting, with a 50% reduction in memory requirements.</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00525](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00525) |
| 621 | Hi-SLAM: Scaling-up Semantics in SLAM with a Hierarchically Categorical Gaussian Splatting | Boying Li,Zhixi Cai,Yuan-Fang Li,Ian Reid,Hamid Rezatofighi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose Hi-SLAM, a semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method featuring a novel hierarchical categorical representation, which enables accurate global 3D semantic mapping, scaling-up capability, and explicit semantic label prediction in the 3D world. The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Furthermore, we enhance the whole SLAM system, resulting in improved tracking and mapping performance. Our Hi-SLAM outperforms existing dense SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy, while achieving a 2x operation speed-up. Additionally, it exhibits competitive performance in rendering semantic segmentation in small synthetic scenes, with significantly reduced storage and training time requirements. Rendering FPS impressively reaches 2,000 with semantic information and 3,000 without it. Most notably, it showcases the capability of handling the complex real-world scene with more than 500 semantic classes, highlighting its valuable scaling-up capability.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12518](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12518) |

Previous methods mainly rely on the implicit neural radiance fields (NeRF) or explicit Gaussian Splatting as the underlying representation, and struggle to achieve satisfactory spatial-temporal consistency and surface appearance. Drawing inspiration from modern 3D animation pipelines, we introduce DreamMesh4D, a novel framework combining mesh representation with geometric skinning technique to generate high-quality 4D object from a monocular video. Instead of utilizing classical texture map for appearance, we bind Gaussian splats to triangle face of mesh for differentiable optimization of both the texture and mesh vertices. In particular, DreamMesh4D begins with a coarse mesh obtained through an image-to-3D generation procedure. Sparse points are then uniformly sampled across the mesh surface, and are used to build a deformation graph to drive the motion of the 3D object for the sake of computational efficiency and providing additional constraint. For each step, transformations of sparse control points are predicted using a deformation network, and the mesh vertices as well as the surface Gaussians are deformed via a novel geometric skinning algorithm, which is a hybrid approach combining LBS (linear blending skinning) and DQS (dual-quaternion skinning), mitigating drawbacks associated with both approaches. The static surface Gaussians and mesh vertices as well as the deformation network are learned via reference view photometric loss, score distillation loss as well as other regularizers in a two-stage manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of our method. Furthermore, our method is compatible with modern graphic pipelines, showcasing its potential in the 3D gaming and film industry.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06756](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06756) |
| 619 | Weak-eval-Strong: Evaluating and Eliciting Lateral Thinking of LLMs with Situation Puzzles | Qi Chen,Bowen Zhang,Gang Wang,Qi Wu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>While advancements in NLP have significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks requiring vertical thinking, their lateral thinking capabilities remain under-explored and challenging to measure due to the complexity of assessing creative thought processes and the scarcity of relevant data. To address these challenges, we introduce SPLAT, a benchmark leveraging Situation Puzzles to evaluate and elicit LAteral Thinking of LLMs. This benchmark, containing 975 graded situation puzzles across three difficulty levels, employs a new multi-turn player-judge framework instead of the traditional model-based evaluation, which often necessitates a stronger evaluation model. This framework simulates an interactive game where the model (player) asks the evaluation model (judge) questions about an incomplete story to infer the full scenario. The judge answers based on a detailed reference scenario or evaluates if the player's predictions align with the reference one. This approach lessens dependence on more robust evaluation models, enabling the assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs. The experiments demonstrate that a robust evaluation model, such as WizardLM-2, closely matches human judgements in both intermediate question-answering and final scenario accuracy, achieving over 80% agreement-similar to the agreement levels among humans. Furthermore, applying data and reasoning processes from our benchmark to other lateral thinking-related benchmarks, e.g., RiddleSense and BrainTeaser, leads to performance enhancements. This suggests that our benchmark effectively evaluates and elicits the lateral thinking abilities of LLMs. Code is available at: https://github.com/chenqi008/LateralThinking.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06733](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06733) |

In particular, with the pretrained diffusion models, existing methods predominantly use Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to train 3D models such as Neural RaRecent advances in text-to-3D generation have made significant progress. In particular, with the pretrained diffusion models, existing methods predominantly use Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to train 3D models such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). However, a hurdle is that they often encounter difficulties with over-smoothing textures and over-saturating colors. The rectified flow model -- which utilizes a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) to represent a straight trajectory -- shows promise as an alternative prior to text-to-3D generation. It learns a time-independent vector field, thereby reducing the ambiguity in 3D model update gradients that are calculated using time-dependent scores in the SDS framework. In light of this, we first develop a mathematical analysis to seamlessly integrate SDS with rectified flow model, paving the way for our initial framework known as Vector Field Distillation Sampling (VFDS). However, empirical findings indicate that VFDS still results in over-smoothing outcomes. Therefore, we analyze the grounding reasons for such a failure from the perspective of ODE trajectories. On top, we propose a novel framework, named FlowDreamer, which yields high fidelity results with richer textual details and faster convergence. The key insight is to leverage the coupling and reversible properties of the rectified flow model to search for the corresponding noise, rather than using randomly sampled noise as in VFDS. Accordingly, we introduce a novel Unique Couple Matching (UCM) loss, which guides the 3D model to optimize along the same trajectory.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05008](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05008) |
| 617 | Free-DyGS: Camera-Pose-Free Scene Reconstruction based on Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Surgical Videos | Qian Li,Shuojue Yang,Daiyun Shen,Yueming Jin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing endoscopic videos is crucial for high-fidelity visualization and the efficiency of surgical operations. Despite the importance, existing 3D reconstruction methods encounter several challenges, including stringent demands for accuracy, imprecise camera positioning, intricate dynamic scenes, and the necessity for rapid reconstruction. Addressing these issues, this paper presents the first camera-pose-free scene reconstruction framework, Free-DyGS, tailored for dynamic surgical videos, leveraging 3D Gaussian splatting technology. Our approach employs a frame-by-frame reconstruction strategy and is delineated into four distinct phases: Scene Initialization, Joint Learning, Scene Expansion, and Retrospective Learning. We introduce a Generalizable Gaussians Parameterization module within the Scene Initialization and Expansion phases to proficiently generate Gaussian attributes for each pixel from the RGBD frames. The Joint Learning phase is crafted to concurrently deduce scene deformation and camera pose, facilitated by an innovative flexible deformation module. In the scene expansion stage, the Gaussian points gradually grow as the camera moves. The Retrospective Learning phase is dedicated to enhancing the precision of scene deformation through the reassessment of prior frames. The efficacy of the proposed Free-DyGS is substantiated through experiments on two datasets: the StereoMIS and Hamlyn datasets. The experimental outcomes underscore that Free-DyGS surpasses conventional baseline models in both rendering fidelity and computational efficiency.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01003](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01003) |

| 615 | HiSplat: Hierarchical 3D Gaussian Splatting for Generalizable Sparse-View Reconstruction | Shengji Tang,Weicai Ye,Peng Ye,Weihao Lin,Yang Zhou,Tao Chen,Wanli Ouyang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing 3D scenes from multiple viewpoints is a fundamental task in stereo vision. Recently, advances in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting have enabled high-quality novel view synthesis for unseen scenes from sparse input views by feed-forward predicting per-pixel Gaussian parameters without extra optimization. However, existing methods typically generate single-scale 3D Gaussians, which lack representation of both large-scale structure and texture details, resulting in mislocation and artefacts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, HiSplat, which introduces a hierarchical manner in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct hierarchical 3D Gaussians via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Specifically, HiSplat generates large coarse-grained Gaussians to capture large-scale structures, followed by fine-grained Gaussians to enhance delicate texture details. To promote inter-scale interactions, we propose an Error Aware Module for Gaussian compensation and a Modulating Fusion Module for Gaussian repair. Our method achieves joint optimization of hierarchical representations, allowing for novel view synthesis using only two-view reference images. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that HiSplat significantly enhances reconstruction quality and cross-dataset generalization compared to prior single-scale methods. The corresponding ablation study and analysis of different-scale 3D Gaussians reveal the mechanism behind the effectiveness.

GSLoc backpropagates pose gradients over the rendering pipeline to align the rendered and target images, while it adopts a coarse-to-fine strategy by utilizing blurring kernels to mitigate the non-convexity of the problem and improve the convergence. The results show that our approach succeeds at visual localization in challenging conditions of relatively small overlap between initial and target frames inside textureless environments when state-of-the-art neural sparse methods provide inferior results. Using the byproduct of realistic rendering from the 3DGS map representation, we show how to enhance localization results by mixing a set of observed and virtual reference keyframes when solving the image retrieval problem. We evaluate our method both on synthetic and real-world data, discussing its advantages and application potential.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06165](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06165) |

This paper particularly focuses on generating sequences of images from the photorealistic Gaussian Splatting models, that match instructions that are given by user-inputted language. We contribute a novel framework, SplaTraj, which formulates the generation of images within photorealistic environment representations as a continuous-time trajectory optimization problem. Costs are designed so that a camera following the trajectory poses will smoothly traverse through the environment and render the specified spatial information in a photogenic manner. This is achieved by querying a photorealistic representation with language embedding to isolate regions that correspond to the user-specified inputs. These regions are then projected to the camera's view as it moves over time and a cost is constructed. We can then apply gradient-based optimization and differentiate through the rendering to optimize the trajectory for the defined cost. The resulting trajectory moves to photogenically view each of the specified objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a suite of environments and instructions, and demonstrate the quality of generated image sequences.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06014](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06014) |
| 612 | Comparative Analysis of Novel View Synthesis and Photogrammetry for 3D Forest Stand Reconstruction and extraction of individual tree parameters | Guoji Tian,Chongcheng Chen,Hongyu Huang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Accurate and efficient 3D reconstruction of trees is crucial for forest resource assessments and management. Close-Range Photogrammetry (CRP) is commonly used for reconstructing forest scenes but faces challenges like low efficiency and poor quality. Recently, Novel View Synthesis (NVS) technologies, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have shown promise for 3D plant reconstruction with limited images. However, existing research mainly focuses on small plants in orchards or individual trees, leaving uncertainty regarding their application in larger, complex forest stands. In this study, we collected sequential images of forest plots with varying complexity and performed dense reconstruction using NeRF and 3DGS. The resulting point clouds were compared with those from photogrammetry and laser scanning. Results indicate that NVS methods significantly enhance reconstruction efficiency. Photogrammetry struggles with complex stands, leading to point clouds with excessive canopy noise and incorrectly reconstructed trees, such as duplicated trunks. NeRF, while better for canopy regions, may produce errors in ground areas with limited views. The 3DGS method generates sparser point clouds, particularly in trunk areas, affecting diameter at breast height (DBH) accuracy. All three methods can extract tree height information, with NeRF yielding the highest accuracy; however, photogrammetry remains superior for DBH accuracy. These findings suggest that NVS methods have significant potential for 3D reconstruction of forest stands, offering valuable support for complex forest resource inventory and visualization tasks.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05772](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05772) |

Moreover, we introduce Multi-resolution Feature Gaussian Splatting (MFGS) to incorporates a latent feature field for flexible feature sampling and Gradient-guided Selective Splitting (GSS) for effective Gaussian upsampling. By integrating these strategies within the coarse-to-fine framework ensure both high fidelity and memory efficiency.

Despite recent advances in text-guided 3D scene editing, integrating 2D VTON into these pipelines to achieve vivid 3D VTON remains challenging. The reasons are twofold. First, text prompts cannot provide sufficient details in describing clothing. Second, 2D VTON results generated from different viewpoints of the same 3D scene lack coherence and spatial relationships, hence frequently leading to appearance inconsistencies and geometric distortions. To resolve these problems, we introduce an image-prompted 3D VTON method (dubbed GS-VTON) which, by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as the 3D representation, enables the transfer of pre-trained knowledge from 2D VTON models to 3D while improving cross-view consistency. (1) Specifically, we propose a personalized diffusion model that utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning to incorporate personalized information into pre-trained 2D VTON models. To achieve effective LoRA training, we introduce a reference-driven image editing approach that enables the simultaneous editing of multi-view images while ensuring consistency. (2) Furthermore, we propose a persona-aware 3DGS editing framework to facilitate effective editing while maintaining consistent cross-view appearance and high-quality 3D geometry. (3) Additionally, we have established a new 3D VTON benchmark, 3D-VTONBench, which facilitates comprehensive qualitative and quantitative 3D VTON evaluations. Through extensive experiments and comparative analyses with existing methods, the proposed \\OM has demonstrated superior fidelity and advanced editing capabilities, affirming its effectiveness for 3D VTON.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05259](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05259) |
| 609 | LiDAR-GS:Real-time LiDAR Re-Simulation using Gaussian Splatting | Qifeng Chen,Sheng Yang,Sicong Du,Tao Tang,Peng Chen,Yuchi Huo | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>LiDAR simulation plays a crucial role in closed-loop simulation for autonomous driving. Although recent advancements, such as the use of reconstructed mesh and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), have made progress in simulating the physical properties of LiDAR, these methods have struggled to achieve satisfactory frame rates and rendering quality. To address these limitations, we present LiDAR-GS, the first LiDAR Gaussian Splatting method, for real-time high-fidelity re-simulation of LiDAR sensor scans in public urban road scenes. The vanilla Gaussian Splatting, designed for camera models, cannot be directly applied to LiDAR re-simulation. To bridge the gap between passive camera and active LiDAR, our LiDAR-GS designs a differentiable laser beam splatting, grounded in the LiDAR range view model. This innovation allows for precise surface splatting by projecting lasers onto micro cross-sections, effectively eliminating artifacts associated with local affine approximations. Additionally, LiDAR-GS leverages Neural Gaussian Fields, which further integrate view-dependent clues, to represent key LiDAR properties that are influenced by the incident angle and external factors. Combining these practices with some essential adaptations, e.g., dynamic instances decomposition, our approach succeeds in simultaneously re-simulating depth, intensity, and ray-drop channels, achieving state-of-the-art results in both rendering frame rate and quality on publically available large scene datasets. Our source code will be made publicly available.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05111](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05111) |

In the context of Space Domain Awareness, since space is becoming increasingly congested, NVS can accurately map space objects and debris, improving the safety and efficiency of space operations. Similarly, in Rendezvous and Proximity Operations missions, 3D models can provide details about a target object's shape, size, and orientation, allowing for better planning and prediction of the target's behavior. In this work, we explore the generalization abilities of these reconstruction techniques, aiming to avoid the necessity of retraining for each new scene, by presenting a novel approach to 3D spacecraft reconstruction from single-view images, DreamSat, by fine-tuning the Zero123 XL, a state-of-the-art single-view reconstruction model, on a high-quality dataset of 190 high-quality spacecraft models and integrating it into the DreamGaussian framework. We demonstrate consistent improvements in reconstruction quality across multiple metrics, including Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) score (+0.33%), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) (+2.53%), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) (+2.38%), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) (+0.16%) on a test set of 30 previously unseen spacecraft images.

| 607 | PhotoReg: Photometrically Registering 3D Gaussian Splatting Models | Ziwen Yuan,Tianyi Zhang,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Building accurate representations of the environment is critical for intelligent robots to make decisions during deployment. Advances in photorealistic environment models have enabled robots to develop hyper-realistic reconstructions, which can be used to generate images that are intuitive for human inspection. In particular, the recently introduced \\ac{3DGS}, which describes the scene with up to millions of primitive ellipsoids, can be rendered in real time. \\ac{3DGS} has rapidly gained prominence. However, a critical unsolved problem persists: how can we fuse multiple \\ac{3DGS} into a single coherent model? Solving this problem will enable robot teams to jointly build \\ac{3DGS} models of their surroundings. A key insight of this work is to leverage the {duality} between photorealistic reconstructions, which render realistic 2D images from 3D structure, and \\emph{3D foundation models}, which predict 3D structure from image pairs. To this end, we develop PhotoReg, a framework to register multiple photorealistic \\ac{3DGS} models with 3D foundation models. As \\ac{3DGS} models are generally built from monocular camera images, they have \\emph{arbitrary scale}. To resolve this, PhotoReg actively enforces scale consistency among the different \\ac{3DGS} models by considering depth estimates within these models. Then, the alignment is iteratively refined with fine-grained photometric losses to produce high-quality fused \\ac{3DGS} models. We rigorously evaluate PhotoReg on both standard benchmark datasets and our custom-collected datasets, including with two quadruped robots. The code is released at \\url{ziweny11.github.io/photoreg}.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05044](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05044) |
| 606 | GS-Hider: Hiding Messages into 3D Gaussian Splatting | Xuanyu Zhang,Jiarui Meng,Runyi Li,Zhipei Xu,Yongbing Zhang,Jian Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has already become the emerging research focus in the fields of 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Given that training a 3DGS requires a significant amount of time and computational cost, it is crucial to protect the copyright, integrity, and privacy of such 3D assets. Steganography, as a crucial technique for encrypted transmission and copyright protection, has been extensively studied. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. Unlike its predecessor NeRF, 3DGS possesses two distinct features: 1) explicit 3D representation; and 2) real-time rendering speeds. These characteristics result in the 3DGS point cloud files being public and transparent, with each Gaussian point having a clear physical significance. Therefore, ensuring the security and fidelity of the original 3D scene while embedding information into the 3DGS point cloud files is an extremely challenging task. To solve the above-mentioned issue, we first propose a steganography framework for 3DGS, dubbed GS-Hider, which can embed 3D scenes and images into original GS point clouds in an invisible manner and accurately extract the hidden messages. Specifically, we design a coupled secured feature attribute to replace the original 3DGS's spherical harmonics coefficients and then use a scene decoder and a message decoder to disentangle the original RGB scene and the hidden message. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed GS-Hider can effectively conceal multimodal messages without compromising rendering quality and possesses exceptional security, robustness, capacity, and flexibility.

In this challenge, we address the task of bimanual category-agnostic hand-object interaction reconstruction, which aims to generate 3D reconstructions of both hands and the object from a monocular video, without relying on predefined templates. This task is particularly challenging due to the significant occlusion and dynamic contact between the hands and the object during bimanual manipulation. We worked to resolve these issues by introducing a mask loss and a 3D contact loss, respectively. Moreover, we applied 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to this task. As a result, our method achieved a value of 38.69 in the main metric, CD$_h$, on the ARCTIC test set.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19215](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19215) |

In this paper, we propose SplatSim, a novel framework that leverages Gaussian Splatting as the primary rendering primitive to reduce the Sim2Real gap for RGB-based manipulation policies. By replacing traditional mesh representations with Gaussian Splats in simulators, SplatSim produces highly photorealistic synthetic data while maintaining the scalability and cost-efficiency of simulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by training manipulation policies within SplatSim and deploying them in the real world in a zero-shot manner, achieving an average success rate of 86.25%, compared to 97.5% for policies trained on real-world data.

Our approach is based on using anchored Gaussian splats, which are designed to overcome the limitations of existing 3D Gaussian splatting algorithms. Prior neural rendering methods suffer from severe splat drift due to scene complexity and insufficient multi-view observation, and can fail to fix splats on the true geometry in ground-robot datasets. Our method integrates pixel-aligned anchors from monocular depths and generates Gaussian splats around these anchors using residual-form Gaussian decoders. To address the inherent scale ambiguity of monocular depth, we parameterize anchors with per-view depth-scales and employ scale-consistent depth loss for online scale calibration. Our method results in improved rendering performance, based on PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, in ground scenes with free trajectory patterns, and achieves state-of-the-art rendering performance on the R3LIVE odometry dataset and the Tanks and Temples dataset.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04646](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04646) |
| 602 | S4D: Streaming 4D Real-World Reconstruction with Gaussians and 3D Control Points | Bing He,Yunuo Chen,Guo Lu,Qi Wang,Qunshan Gu,Rong Xie,Li Song,Wenjun Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Dynamic scene reconstruction using Gaussians has recently attracted increased interest. Mainstream approaches typically employ a global deformation field to warp a 3D scene in canonical space. However, the inherent low-frequency nature of implicit neural fields often leads to ineffective representations of complex motions. Moreover, their structural rigidity can hinder adaptation to scenes with varying resolutions and durations. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach for streaming 4D real-world reconstruction utilizing discrete 3D control points. This method physically models local rays and establishes a motion-decoupling coordinate system. By effectively merging traditional graphics with learnable pipelines, it provides a robust and efficient local 6-degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) motion representation. Additionally, we have developed a generalized framework that integrates our control points with Gaussians. Starting from an initial 3D reconstruction, our workflow decomposes the streaming 4D reconstruction into four independent submodules: 3D segmentation, 3D control point generation, object-wise motion manipulation, and residual compensation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D Gaussian splatting techniques on both the Neu3DV and CMU-Panoptic datasets. Notably, the optimization of our 3D control points is achievable in 100 iterations and within just 2 seconds per frame on a single NVIDIA 4070 GPU.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13036](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13036) |
| 601 | GaussianBlock: Building Part-Aware Compositional and Editable 3D Scene by Primitives and Gaussians | Shuyi Jiang,Qihao Zhao,Hossein Rahmani,De Wen Soh,Jun Liu,Na Zhao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, with the development of Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting, 3D reconstruction techniques have achieved remarkably high fidelity. However, the latent representations learnt by these methods are highly entangled and lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel part-aware compositional reconstruction method, called GaussianBlock, that enables semantically coherent and disentangled representations, allowing for precise and physical editing akin to building blocks, while simultaneously maintaining high fidelity. Our GaussianBlock introduces a hybrid representation that leverages the advantages of both primitives, known for their flexible actionability and editability, and 3D Gaussians, which excel in reconstruction quality. Specifically, we achieve semantically coherent primitives through a novel attention-guided centering loss derived from 2D semantic priors, complemented by a dynamic splitting and fusion strategy. Furthermore, we utilize 3D Gaussians that hybridize with primitives to refine structural details and enhance fidelity. Additionally, a binding inheritance strategy is employed to strengthen and maintain the connection between the two. Our reconstructed scenes are evidenced to be disentangled, compositional, and compact across diverse benchmarks, enabling seamless, direct and precise editing while maintaining high quality.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01535](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01535) |
| 600 | Variational Bayes Gaussian Splatting | Toon Van de Maele,Ozan Catal,Alexander Tschantz,Christopher L. Buckley,Tim Verbelen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a promising approach for modeling 3D scenes using mixtures of Gaussians. The predominant optimization method for these models relies on backpropagating gradients through a differentiable rendering pipeline, which struggles with catastrophic forgetting when dealing with continuous streams of data. To address this limitation, we propose Variational Bayes Gaussian Splatting (VBGS), a novel approach that frames training a Gaussian splat as variational inference over model parameters. By leveraging the conjugacy properties of multivariate Gaussians, we derive a closed-form variational update rule, allowing efficient updates from partial, sequential observations without the need for replay buffers. Our experiments show that VBGS not only matches state-of-the-art performance on static datasets, but also enables continual learning from sequentially streamed 2D and 3D data, drastically improving performance in this setting.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03592](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03592) |

Our key insight is that the powerful novel view synthesis capabilities provided by modern inverse rendering methods (e.g.,~3D Gaussian splatting) allow one to perform flash/no-flash reflection separation using unpaired measurements -- this relaxation dramatically simplifies image acquisition over conventional paired flash/no-flash reflection separation methods. Through extensive real-world experiments, we demonstrate our method, Flash-Splat, accurately reconstructs both transmitted and reflected scenes in 3D.

| 598 | GI-GS: Global Illumination Decomposition on Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering | Hongze Chen,Zehong Lin,Jun Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present GI-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and deferred shading to achieve photo-realistic novel view synthesis and relighting. In inverse rendering, accurately modeling the shading processes of objects is essential for achieving high-fidelity results. Therefore, it is critical to incorporate global illumination to account for indirect lighting that reaches an object after multiple bounces across the scene. Previous 3DGS-based methods have attempted to model indirect lighting by characterizing indirect illumination as learnable lighting volumes or additional attributes of each Gaussian, while using baked occlusion to represent shadow effects. These methods, however, fail to accurately model the complex physical interactions between light and objects, making it impossible to construct realistic indirect illumination during relighting. To address this limitation, we propose to calculate indirect lighting using efficient path tracing with deferred shading. In our framework, we first render a G-buffer to capture the detailed geometry and material properties of the scene. Then, we perform physically-based rendering (PBR) only for direct lighting. With the G-buffer and previous rendering results, the indirect lighting can be calculated through a lightweight path tracing. Our method effectively models indirect lighting under any given lighting conditions, thereby achieving better novel view synthesis and relighting. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our GI-GS outperforms existing baselines in both rendering quality and efficiency.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02619](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02619) |
| 597 | SRIF: Semantic Shape Registration Empowered by Diffusion-based Image Morphing and Flow Estimation | Mingze Sun,Chen Guo,Puhua Jiang,Shiwei Mao,Yurun Chen,Ruqi Huang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we propose SRIF, a novel Semantic shape Registration framework based on diffusion-based Image morphing and Flow estimation. More concretely, given a pair of extrinsically aligned shapes, we first render them from multi-views, and then utilize an image interpolation framework based on diffusion models to generate sequences of intermediate images between them. The images are later fed into a dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting framework, with which we reconstruct and post-process for intermediate point clouds respecting the image morphing processing. In the end, tailored for the above, we propose a novel registration module to estimate continuous normalizing flow, which deforms source shape consistently towards the target, with intermediate point clouds as weak guidance. Our key insight is to leverage large vision models (LVMs) to associate shapes and therefore obtain much richer semantic information on the relationship between shapes than the ad-hoc feature extraction and alignment. As a consequence, SRIF achieves high-quality dense correspondences on challenging shape pairs, but also delivers smooth, semantically meaningful interpolation in between. Empirical evidence justifies the effectiveness and superiority of our method as well as specific design choices.

However, existing generative techniques either focus solely on dynamic objects or perform outpainting from a single perspective image, failing to meet the requirements of VR/AR applications that need free-viewpoint, 360$^{\\circ}$ virtual views where users can move in all directions. In this work, we tackle the challenging task of elevating a single panorama to an immersive 4D experience. For the first time, we demonstrate the capability to generate omnidirectional dynamic scenes with 360$^{\\circ}$ views at 4K (4096 $\\times$ 2048) resolution, thereby providing an immersive user experience. Our method introduces a pipeline that facilitates natural scene animations and optimizes a set of dynamic Gaussians using efficient splatting techniques for real-time exploration. To overcome the lack of scene-scale annotated 4D data and models, especially in panoramic formats, we propose a novel \\textbf{Panoramic Denoiser} that adapts generic 2D diffusion priors to animate consistently in 360$^{\\circ}$ images, transforming them into panoramic videos with dynamic scenes at targeted regions. Subsequently, we propose \\textbf{Dynamic Panoramic Lifting} to elevate the panoramic video into a 4D immersive environment while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. By transferring prior knowledge from 2D models in the perspective domain to the panoramic domain and the 4D lifting with spatial appearance and geometry regularization, we achieve high-quality Panorama-to-4D generation at a resolution of 4K for the first time.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13527](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13527) |
| 595 | MVGS: Multi-view-regulated Gaussian Splatting for Novel View Synthesis | Xiaobiao Du,Yida Wang,Xin Yu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent works in volume rendering, \\textit{e.g.} NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), significantly advance the rendering quality and efficiency with the help of the learned implicit neural radiance field or 3D Gaussians. Rendering on top of an explicit representation, the vanilla 3DGS and its variants deliver real-time efficiency by optimizing the parametric model with single-view supervision per iteration during training which is adopted from NeRF. Consequently, certain views are overfitted, leading to unsatisfying appearance in novel-view synthesis and imprecise 3D geometries. To solve aforementioned problems, we propose a new 3DGS optimization method embodying four key novel contributions: 1) We transform the conventional single-view training paradigm into a multi-view training strategy. With our proposed multi-view regulation, 3D Gaussian attributes are further optimized without overfitting certain training views. As a general solution, we improve the overall accuracy in a variety of scenarios and different Gaussian variants. 2) Inspired by the benefit introduced by additional views, we further propose a cross-intrinsic guidance scheme, leading to a coarse-to-fine training procedure concerning different resolutions. 3) Built on top of our multi-view regulated training, we further propose a cross-ray densification strategy, densifying more Gaussian kernels in the ray-intersect regions from a selection of views. 4) By further investigating the densification strategy, we found that the effect of densification should be enhanced when certain views are distinct dramatically. As a solution, we propose a novel multi-view augmented densification strategy, where 3D Gaussians are encouraged to get densified to a sufficient number accordingly, resulting in improved reconstruction accuracy.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02103](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02103) |

Nevertheless, despite its exceptional rendering quality and performance on standard datasets, 3D-GS frequently encounters difficulties in accurately modeling specular and anisotropic components. This issue stems from the limited ability of spherical harmonics (SH) to represent high-frequency information. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Spec-Gaussian, an approach that utilizes an anisotropic spherical Gaussian (ASG) appearance field instead of SH for modeling the view-dependent appearance of each 3D Gaussian. Additionally, we have developed a coarse-to-fine training strategy to improve learning efficiency and eliminate floaters caused by overfitting in real-world scenes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of rendering quality. Thanks to ASG, we have significantly improved the ability of 3D-GS to model scenes with specular and anisotropic components without increasing the number of 3D Gaussians.

To improve the robustness of our model in challenging outdoor environments, we incorporate an exposure-adaptive module within the 3DGS framework. Consequently, GSLoc enables efficient one-shot pose refinement given a single RGB query and a coarse initial pose estimation.

| 591 | 3DGS-DET: Empower 3D Gaussian Splatting with Boundary Guidance and Box-Focused Sampling for 3D Object Detection | Yang Cao,Yuanliang Jv,Dan Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are widely used for novel-view synthesis and have been adapted for 3D Object Detection (3DOD), offering a promising approach to 3DOD through view-synthesis representation. However, NeRF faces inherent limitations: (i) limited representational capacity for 3DOD due to its implicit nature, and (ii) slow rendering speeds. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an explicit 3D representation that addresses these limitations. Inspired by these advantages, this paper introduces 3DGS into 3DOD for the first time, identifying two main challenges: (i) Ambiguous spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs: 3DGS primarily relies on 2D pixel-level supervision, resulting in unclear 3D spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs and poor differentiation between objects and background, which hinders 3DOD; (ii) Excessive background blobs: 2D images often include numerous background pixels, leading to densely reconstructed 3DGS with many noisy Gaussian blobs representing the background, negatively affecting detection. To tackle the challenge (i), we leverage the fact that 3DGS reconstruction is derived from 2D images, and propose an elegant and efficient solution by incorporating 2D Boundary Guidance to significantly enhance the spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs, resulting in clearer differentiation between objects and their background. To address the challenge (ii), we propose a Box-Focused Sampling strategy using 2D boxes to generate object probability distribution in 3D spaces, allowing effective probabilistic sampling in 3D to retain more object blobs and reduce noisy background blobs. Benefiting from our designs, our 3DGS-DET significantly outperforms the SOTA NeRF-based method, NeRF-Det, achieving improvements of +6.6 on mAP@0.25 and +8.1 on mAP@0.5 for the ScanNet dataset, and impressive +31.5 on mAP@0.25 for the ARKITScenes dataset.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01647](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01647) |

However, in scenarios involving reflective surfaces, particularly mirrors, 3D-GS often misinterprets reflections as virtual spaces, resulting in blurred and inconsistent multi-view rendering within mirrors. Our paper presents a novel method aimed at obtaining high-quality multi-view consistent reflection rendering by modelling reflections as physically-based virtual cameras. We estimate mirror planes with depth and normal estimates from 3D-GS and define virtual cameras that are placed symmetrically about the mirror plane. These virtual cameras are then used to explain mirror reflections in the scene. To address imperfections in mirror plane estimates, we propose a straightforward yet effective virtual camera optimization method to enhance reflection quality. We collect a new mirror dataset including three real-world scenarios for more diverse evaluation. Experimental validation on both Mirror-Nerf and our real-world dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We achieve comparable or superior results while significantly reducing training time compared to previous state-of-the-art.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01614](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01614) |

Traditional image-based INRs employ neural networks to map pixel coordinates to RGB values, capturing shapes, colors, and textures within the network's weights. Recently, GaussianImage has been proposed as an alternative, using Gaussian functions instead of neural networks to achieve comparable quality and compression. Such a solution obtains a quality and compression ratio similar to classical INR models but does not allow image modification. In contrast, our work introduces a novel method, MiraGe, which uses mirror reflections to perceive 2D images in 3D space and employs flat-controlled Gaussians for precise 2D image editing. Our approach improves the rendering quality and allows realistic image modifications, including human-inspired perception of photos in the 3D world. Thanks to modeling images in 3D space, we obtain the illusion of 3D-based modification in 2D images. We also show that our Gaussian representation can be easily combined with a physics engine to produce physics-based modification of 2D images. Consequently, MiraGe allows for better quality than the standard approach and natural modification of 2D images.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01521](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01521) |

| 586 | EVA-Gaussian: 3D Gaussian-based Real-time Human Novel View Synthesis under Diverse Camera Settings | Yingdong Hu,Zhening Liu,Jiawei Shao,Zehong Lin,Jun Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The feed-forward based 3D Gaussian Splatting method has demonstrated exceptional capability in real-time human novel view synthesis. However, existing approaches are restricted to dense viewpoint settings, which limits their flexibility in free-viewpoint rendering across a wide range of camera view angle discrepancies. To address this limitation, we propose a real-time pipeline named EVA-Gaussian for 3D human novel view synthesis across diverse camera settings. Specifically, we first introduce an Efficient cross-View Attention (EVA) module to accurately estimate the position of each 3D Gaussian from the source images. Then, we integrate the source images with the estimated Gaussian position map to predict the attributes and feature embeddings of the 3D Gaussians. Moreover, we employ a recurrent feature refiner to correct artifacts caused by geometric errors in position estimation and enhance visual fidelity.To further improve synthesis quality, we incorporate a powerful anchor loss function for both 3D Gaussian attributes and human face landmarks. Experimental results on the THuman2.0 and THumansit datasets showcase the superiority of our EVA-Gaussian approach in rendering quality across diverse camera settings.

| 585 | Gaussian-Det: Learning Closed-Surface Gaussians for 3D Object Detection | Hongru Yan,Yu Zheng,Yueqi Duan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Skins wrapping around our bodies, leathers covering over the sofa, sheet metal coating the car - it suggests that objects are enclosed by a series of continuous surfaces, which provides us with informative geometry prior for objectness deduction. In this paper, we propose Gaussian-Det which leverages Gaussian Splatting as surface representation for multi-view based 3D object detection. Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface closure of the object proposal. In this way, the surface information Gaussian-Det exploits serves as the prior on the quality and reliability of objectness and the information basis of proposal refinement. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Gaussian-Det outperforms various existing approaches, in terms of both average precision and recall.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01404](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01404) |
| 584 | DreamCatalyst: Fast and High-Quality 3D Editing via Controlling Editability and Identity Preservation | Jiwook Kim,Seonho Lee,Jaeyo Shin,Jiho Choi,Hyunjung Shim | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks, leveraging diffusion models for 3D consistent editing. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality. DreamCatalyst also surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing methods, establishing itself as an effective and model-agnostic 3D editing solution.

| 583 | High-Fidelity SLAM Using Gaussian Splatting with Rendering-Guided Densification and Regularized Optimization | Shuo Sun,Malcolm Mielle,Achim J. Lilienthal,Martin Magnusson | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose a dense RGBD SLAM system based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that provides metrically accurate pose tracking and visually realistic reconstruction. To this end, we first propose a Gaussian densification strategy based on the rendering loss to map unobserved areas and refine reobserved areas. Second, we introduce extra regularization parameters to alleviate the forgetting problem in the continuous mapping problem, where parameters tend to overfit the latest frame and result in decreasing rendering quality for previous frames. Both mapping and tracking are performed with Gaussian parameters by minimizing re-rendering loss in a differentiable way. Compared to recent neural and concurrently developed gaussian splatting RGBD SLAM baselines, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the synthetic dataset Replica and competitive results on the real-world dataset TUM.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12535](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12535) |

To better understand these activities, it is crucial to model their interactions with the environment captured through dynamic changes. The recent availability of affordable head-mounted cameras and egocentric data offers a more accessible and efficient means to understand human-object interactions in 3D environments. However, most existing methods for human activity modeling neglect the dynamic interactions with objects, resulting in only static representations. The few existing solutions often require inputs from multiple sources, including multi-camera setups, depth-sensing cameras, or kinesthetic sensors. To this end, we introduce EgoGaussian, the first method capable of simultaneously reconstructing 3D scenes and dynamically tracking 3D object motion from RGB egocentric input alone. We leverage the uniquely discrete nature of Gaussian Splatting and segment dynamic interactions from the background, with both having explicit representations. Our approach employs a clip-level online learning pipeline that leverages the dynamic nature of human activities, allowing us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the scene in chronological order and track rigid object motion. EgoGaussian shows significant improvements in terms of both dynamic object and background reconstruction quality compared to the state-of-the-art. We also qualitatively demonstrate the high quality of the reconstructed models.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19811](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19811) |
| 581 | Seamless Augmented Reality Integration in Arthroscopy: A Pipeline for Articular Reconstruction and Guidance | Hongchao Shu,Mingxu Liu,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Suxi Gu,Ping-Cheng Ku,Jonathan Knopf,Russell Taylor,Mathias Unberath | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to diagnose and treat joint problems. The clinical workflow of arthroscopy typically involves inserting an arthroscope into the joint through a small incision, during which surgeons navigate and operate largely by relying on their visual assessment through the arthroscope. However, the arthroscope's restricted field of view and lack of depth perception pose challenges in navigating complex articular structures and achieving surgical precision during procedures. Aiming at enhancing intraoperative awareness, we present a robust pipeline that incorporates simultaneous localization and mapping, depth estimation, and 3D Gaussian splatting to realistically reconstruct intra-articular structures solely based on monocular arthroscope video. Extending 3D reconstruction to Augmented Reality (AR) applications, our solution offers AR assistance for articular notch measurement and annotation anchoring in a human-in-the-loop manner. Compared to traditional Structure-from-Motion and Neural Radiance Field-based methods, our pipeline achieves dense 3D reconstruction and competitive rendering fidelity with explicit 3D representation in 7 minutes on average. When evaluated on four phantom datasets, our method achieves RMSE = 2.21mm reconstruction error, PSNR = 32.86 and SSIM = 0.89 on average. Because our pipeline enables AR reconstruction and guidance directly from monocular arthroscopy without any additional data and/or hardware, our solution may hold the potential for enhancing intraoperative awareness and facilitating surgical precision in arthroscopy. Our AR measurement tool achieves accuracy within 1.59 +/- 1.81mm and the AR annotation tool achieves a mIoU of 0.721.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00386](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00386) |
| 580 | GSPR: Multimodal Place Recognition Using 3D Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Driving | Zhangshuo Qi,Junyi Ma,Jingyi Xu,Zijie Zhou,Luqi Cheng,Guangming Xiong | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Place recognition is a crucial module to ensure autonomous vehicles obtain usable localization information in GPS-denied environments. In recent years, multimodal place recognition methods have gained increasing attention due to their ability to overcome the weaknesses of unimodal sensor systems by leveraging complementary information from different modalities. However, challenges arise from the necessity of harmonizing data across modalities and exploiting the spatio-temporal correlations between them sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based multimodal place recognition neural network dubbed GSPR. It explicitly combines multi-view RGB images and LiDAR point clouds into a spatio-temporally unified scene representation with the proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. A network composed of 3D graph convolution and transformer is designed to extract high-level spatio-temporal features and global descriptors from the Gaussian scenes for place recognition. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively leverage complementary strengths of both multi-view cameras and LiDAR, achieving SOTA place recognition performance while maintaining solid generalization ability.

However, recent Sim2real methods either rely on a large amount of augmented data or large learning models, which is inefficient for specific tasks. In recent years, radiance field-based reconstruction methods, especially the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting, making it possible to reproduce realistic real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel real-to-sim-to-real reinforcement learning framework, RL-GSBridge, which introduces a mesh-based 3D Gaussian Splatting method to realize zero-shot sim-to-real transfer for vision-based deep reinforcement learning. We improve the mesh-based 3D GS modeling method by using soft binding constraints, enhancing the rendering quality of mesh models. We then employ a GS editing approach to synchronize rendering with the physics simulator, reflecting the interactions of the physical robot more accurately. Through a series of sim-to-real robotic arm experiments, including grasping and pick-and-place tasks, we demonstrate that RL-GSBridge maintains a satisfactory success rate in real-world task completion during sim-to-real transfer. Furthermore, a series of rendering metrics and visualization results indicate that our proposed mesh-based 3D Gaussian reduces artifacts in unstructured objects, demonstrating more realistic rendering performance.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20291](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20291) |
| 578 | Feature Splatting for Better Novel View Synthesis with Low Overlap | T. Berriel Martins,Javier Civera | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a very promising scene representation, achieving state-of-the-art quality in novel view synthesis significantly faster than competing alternatives. However, its use of spherical harmonics to represent scene colors limits the expressivity of 3D Gaussians and, as a consequence, the capability of the representation to generalize as we move away from the training views. In this paper, we propose to encode the color information of 3D Gaussians into per-Gaussian feature vectors, which we denote as Feature Splatting (FeatSplat). To synthesize a novel view, Gaussians are first "splatted" into the image plane, then the corresponding feature vectors are alpha-blended, and finally the blended vector is decoded by a small MLP to render the RGB pixel values. To further inform the model, we concatenate a camera embedding to the blended feature vector, to condition the decoding also on the viewpoint information. Our experiments show that these novel model for encoding the radiance considerably improves novel view synthesis for low overlap views that are distant from the training views. Finally, we also show the capacity and convenience of our feature vector representation, demonstrating its capability not only to generate RGB values for novel views, but also their per-pixel semantic labels.

| 577 | Robust Gaussian Splatting SLAM by Leveraging Loop Closure | Zunjie Zhu,Youxu Fang,Xin Li,Chengang Yan,Feng Xu,Chau Yuen,Yanyan Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting algorithms excel in novel view rendering applications and have been adapted to extend the capabilities of traditional SLAM systems. However, current Gaussian Splatting SLAM methods, designed mainly for hand-held RGB or RGB-D sensors, struggle with tracking drifts when used with rotating RGB-D camera setups. In this paper, we propose a robust Gaussian Splatting SLAM architecture that utilizes inputs from rotating multiple RGB-D cameras to achieve accurate localization and photorealistic rendering performance. The carefully designed Gaussian Splatting Loop Closure module effectively addresses the issue of accumulated tracking and mapping errors found in conventional Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems. First, each Gaussian is associated with an anchor frame and categorized as historical or novel based on its timestamp. By rendering different types of Gaussians at the same viewpoint, the proposed loop detection strategy considers both co-visibility relationships and distinct rendering outcomes. Furthermore, a loop closure optimization approach is proposed to remove camera pose drift and maintain the high quality of 3D Gaussian models. The approach uses a lightweight pose graph optimization algorithm to correct pose drift and updates Gaussians based on the optimized poses. Additionally, a bundle adjustment scheme further refines camera poses using photometric and geometric constraints, ultimately enhancing the global consistency of scenarios. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in camera pose estimation and novel view rendering tasks. The code will be open-sourced for the community.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20111](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20111) |

We also introduce a novel pixel-aligned sampling scheme with UV positional encoding to ensure the throughput and rendering quality of GauFace assets generated by our TransGS. Once trained, TransGS can instantly translate facial assets with lighting conditions to GauFace representation, With the rich conditioning modalities, it also enables editing and animation capabilities reminiscent of traditional CG pipelines.  We conduct extensive evaluations and user studies, compared to traditional offline and online renderers, as well as recent neural rendering methods, which demonstrate the superior performance of our approach for facial asset rendering. We also showcase diverse immersive applications of facial assets using our TransGS approach and GauFace representation, across various platforms like PCs, phones and even VR headsets.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07441](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07441) |

In response to these challenges, this study introduces the novel task of 3D Reconstruction in Rainy Environments (3DRRE), specifically designed to address the complexities of reconstructing 3D scenes under rainy conditions. To benchmark this task, we construct the HydroViews dataset that comprises a diverse collection of both synthesized and real-world scene images characterized by various intensities of rain streaks and raindrops.

| 574 | Fast-Convergent and Communication-Alleviated Heterogeneous Hierarchical Federated Learning in Autonomous Driving | Wei-Bin Kou,Qingfeng Lin,Ming Tang,Rongguang Ye,Shuai Wang,Guangxu Zhu,Yik-Chung Wu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as TriSU) is a complex task for autonomous driving (AD). However, inference model trained from data in a particular geographical region faces poor generalization when applied in other regions due to inter-city data domain-shift. Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) offers a potential solution for improving TriSU model generalization by collaborative privacy-preserving training over distributed datasets from different cities. Unfortunately, it suffers from slow convergence because data from different cities are with disparate statistical properties. Going beyond existing HFL methods, we propose a Gaussian heterogeneous HFL algorithm (FedGau) to address inter-city data heterogeneity so that convergence can be accelerated. In the proposed FedGau algorithm, both single RGB image and RGB dataset are modelled as Gaussian distributions for aggregation weight design. This approach not only differentiates each RGB image by respective statistical distribution, but also exploits the statistics of dataset from each city in addition to the conventionally considered data volume. With the proposed approach, the convergence is accelerated by 35.5\\%-40.6\\% compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) HFL methods. On the other hand, to reduce the involved communication resource, we further introduce a novel performance-aware adaptive resource scheduling (AdapRS) policy. Unlike the traditional static resource scheduling policy that exchanges a fixed number of models between two adjacent aggregations, AdapRS adjusts the number of model aggregation at different levels of HFL so that unnecessary communications are minimized. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdapRS saves 29.65\\% communication overhead compared to conventional static resource scheduling policy while maintaining almost the same performance.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19560](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19560) |
| 573 | Splatfacto-W: A Nerfstudio Implementation of Gaussian Splatting for Unconstrained Photo Collections | Congrong Xu,Justin Kerr,Angjoo Kanazawa | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis from unconstrained in-the-wild image collections remains a significant yet challenging task due to photometric variations and transient occluders that complicate accurate scene reconstruction. Previous methods have approached these issues by integrating per-image appearance features embeddings in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers faster training and real-time rendering, adapting it for unconstrained image collections is non-trivial due to the substantially different architecture. In this paper, we introduce Splatfacto-W, an approach that integrates per-Gaussian neural color features and per-image appearance embeddings into the rasterization process, along with a spherical harmonics-based background model to represent varying photometric appearances and better depict backgrounds. Our key contributions include latent appearance modeling, efficient transient object handling, and precise background modeling. Splatfacto-W delivers high-quality, real-time novel view synthesis with improved scene consistency in in-the-wild scenarios. Our method improves the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by an average of 5.3 dB compared to 3DGS, enhances training speed by 150 times compared to NeRF-based methods, and achieves a similar rendering speed to 3DGS.

This paper explores the use of event cameras for motion tracking thereby providing a solution with inherent robustness under difficult dynamics and illumination. In order to circumvent the challenge of event camera-based mapping, the solution is framed in a cross-modal way. It tracks a map representation that comes directly from frame-based cameras. Specifically, the proposed method operates on top of gaussian splatting, a state-of-the-art representation that permits highly efficient and realistic novel view synthesis. The key of our approach consists of a novel pose parametrization that uses a reference pose plus first order dynamics for local differential image rendering. The latter is then compared against images of integrated events in a staggered coarse-to-fine optimization scheme. As demonstrated by our results, the realistic view rendering ability of gaussian splatting leads to stable and accurate tracking across a variety of both publicly available and newly recorded data sequences.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19228](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19228) |

To tackle the dynamic contents and the occlusions in complex scenes, we present a space-time 2D Gaussian Splatting approach. Specifically, to improve geometric quality in dynamic scenes, we learn canonical 2D Gaussian splats and deform these 2D Gaussian splats while enforcing the disks of the Gaussian located on the surface of the objects by introducing depth and normal regularizers. Further, to tackle the occlusion issues in complex scenes, we introduce a compositional opacity deformation strategy, which further reduces the surface recovery of those occluded areas. Experiments on real-world sparse-view video datasets and monocular dynamic datasets demonstrate that our reconstructions outperform state-of-the-art methods, especially for the surface of the details.

To obtain good latent vectors describing the scenes, recent works incorporate the 3D-aware latent-conditioned NeRF pipeline into scene representation learning. However, these NeRF-related methods struggle to perceive 3D structural information due to the inefficient dense sampling in volumetric rendering. Moreover, they lack fine-grained semantic information included in their scene representation vectors because they evenly consider free and occupied spaces. Both of them can destroy the performance of downstream RL tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel framework that adopts the efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to learn 3D scene representation for the first time. In brief, we present the Query-based Generalizable 3DGS to bridge the 3DGS technique and scene representations with more geometrical awareness than those in NeRFs. Moreover, we present the Hierarchical Semantics Encoding to ground the fine-grained semantic features to 3D Gaussians and further distilled to the scene representation vectors. We conduct extensive experiments on two RL platforms including Maniskill2 and Robomimic across 10 different tasks. The results show that our method outperforms the other 5 baselines by a large margin.

However, these approaches are built on a tremendous number of redundant 3D Gaussian ellipsoids, leading to high memory and storage costs, and slow training speed. To address the limitation, we propose a compact 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that reduces the number and the parameter size of Gaussian ellipsoids. A sliding window-based masking strategy is first proposed to reduce the redundant ellipsoids. Then we observe that the covariance matrix (geometry) of most 3D Gaussian ellipsoids are extremely similar, which motivates a novel geometry codebook to compress 3D Gaussian geometric attributes, i.e., the parameters. Robust and accurate pose estimation is achieved by a global bundle adjustment method with reprojection loss.

Splat-MOVER consists of: (i) ASK-Splat, a GSplat representation that distills semantic and grasp affordance features into the 3D scene. ASK-Splat enables geometric, semantic, and affordance understanding of 3D scenes, which is critical in many robotics tasks; (ii) SEE-Splat, a real-time scene-editing module using 3D semantic masking and infilling to visualize the motions of objects that result from robot interactions in the real-world. SEE-Splat creates a "digital twin" of the evolving environment throughout the manipulation task; and (iii) Grasp-Splat, a grasp generation module that uses ASK-Splat and SEE-Splat to propose affordance-aligned candidate grasps for open-world objects. ASK-Splat is trained in real-time from RGB images in a brief scanning phase prior to operation, while SEE-Splat and Grasp-Splat run in real-time during operation. We demonstrate the superior performance of Splat-MOVER in hardware experiments on a Kinova robot compared to two recent baselines in four single-stage, open-vocabulary manipulation tasks and in four multi-stage manipulation tasks, using the edited scene to reflect changes due to prior manipulation stages, which is not possible with existing baselines.

| 566 | CompGS: Smaller and Faster Gaussian Splatting with Vector Quantization | KL Navaneet,Kossar Pourahmadi Meibodi,Soroush Abbasi Koohpayegani,Hamed Pirsiavash | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new method for modeling and rendering 3D radiance fields that achieves much faster learning and rendering time compared to SOTA NeRF methods. However, it comes with a drawback in the much larger storage demand compared to NeRF methods since it needs to store the parameters for several 3D Gaussians. We notice that many Gaussians may share similar parameters, so we introduce a simple vector quantization method based on K-means to quantize the Gaussian parameters while optimizing them. Then, we store the small codebook along with the index of the code for each Gaussian. We compress the indices further by sorting them and using a method similar to run-length encoding. Moreover, we use a simple regularizer to encourage zero opacity (invisible Gaussians) to reduce the storage and rendering time by a large factor through reducing the number of Gaussians. We do extensive experiments on standard benchmarks as well as an existing 3D dataset that is an order of magnitude larger than the standard benchmarks used in this field. We show that our simple yet effective method can reduce the storage cost for 3DGS by 40 to 50x and rendering time by 2 to 3x with a very small drop in the quality of rendered images.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18159](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18159) |

Further, we develop a parallelized motion planning algorithm that can exploit the Gaussian map for real-time navigation. The Gaussian map constructed onboard the robot is optimized for both photometric and geometric quality while enabling real-time situational awareness for autonomy. We show through simulation experiments that our method is competitive with approaches that use alternate information gain metrics, while being orders of magnitude faster to compute. In real-world experiments, our algorithm achieves better map quality (10% higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and 30% higher geometric reconstruction accuracy) than Gaussian maps constructed by traditional exploration baselines.

We present a mapping system that incrementally builds a Language-Embedded Gaussian Splat (LEGS): a detailed 3D scene representation that encodes both appearance and semantics in a unified representation. LEGS is trained online as a robot traverses its environment to enable localization of open-vocabulary object queries. We evaluate LEGS on 4 room-scale scenes where we query for objects in the scene to assess how LEGS can capture semantic meaning. We compare LEGS to LERF and find that while both systems have comparable object query success rates, LEGS trains over 3.5x faster than LERF. Results suggest that a multi-camera setup and incremental bundle adjustment can boost visual reconstruction quality in constrained robot trajectories, and suggest LEGS can localize open-vocabulary and long-tail object queries with up to 66% accuracy.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18108](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18108) |
| 563 | Gaussian Deja-vu: Creating Controllable 3D Gaussian Head-Avatars with Enhanced Generalization and Personalization Abilities | Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have unlocked significant potential for modeling 3D head avatars, providing greater flexibility than mesh-based methods and more efficient rendering compared to NeRF-based approaches. Despite these advancements, the creation of controllable 3DGS-based head avatars remains time-intensive, often requiring tens of minutes to hours. To expedite this process, we here introduce the ``Gaussian D\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0-vu" framework, which first obtains a generalized model of the head avatar and then personalizes the result. The generalized model is trained on large 2D (synthetic and real) image datasets. This model provides a well-initialized 3D Gaussian head that is further refined using a monocular video to achieve the personalized head avatar. For personalizing, we propose learnable expression-aware rectification blendmaps to correct the initial 3D Gaussians, ensuring rapid convergence without the reliance on neural networks. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method meets its objectives. It outperforms state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian head avatars in terms of photorealistic quality as well as reduces training time consumption to at least a quarter of the existing methods, producing the avatar in minutes.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16147](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16147) |

Existing approaches demonstrate proficiency in transferring colors and textures but often struggle with replicating the geometry of the scenes. In our work, we leverage an explicit Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation and directly match the distributions of Gaussians between style and content scenes using the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). By employing the entropy-regularized Wasserstein-2 distance, we ensure that the transformation maintains spatial smoothness. Additionally, we decompose the scene stylization problem into smaller chunks to enhance efficiency. This paradigm shift reframes stylization from a pure generative process driven by latent space losses to an explicit matching of distributions between two Gaussian representations. Our method achieves high-resolution 3D stylization by faithfully transferring details from 3D style scenes onto the content scene. Furthermore, WaSt-3D consistently delivers results across diverse content and style scenes without necessitating any training, as it relies solely on optimization-based techniques.

| 561 | EAGLES: Efficient Accelerated 3D Gaussians with Lightweight EncodingS | Sharath Girish,Kamal Gupta,Abhinav Shrivastava | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) has gained popularity in novel-view scene synthesis. It addresses the challenges of lengthy training times and slow rendering speeds associated with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Through rapid, differentiable rasterization of 3D Gaussians, 3D-GS achieves real-time rendering and accelerated training. They, however, demand substantial memory resources for both training and storage, as they require millions of Gaussians in their point cloud representation for each scene. We present a technique utilizing quantized embeddings to significantly reduce per-point memory storage requirements and a coarse-to-fine training strategy for a faster and more stable optimization of the Gaussian point clouds. Our approach develops a pruning stage which results in scene representations with fewer Gaussians, leading to faster training times and rendering speeds for real-time rendering of high resolution scenes. We reduce storage memory by more than an order of magnitude all while preserving the reconstruction quality. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of datasets and scenes preserving the visual quality while consuming 10-20x lesser memory and faster training/inference speed.

Most existing radiance-field-based SLAM systems mainly focus on bounded indoor environments, equipped with RGB-D or RGB sensors. However, they are prone to decline when expanding to unbounded scenes or encountering adverse conditions, such as violent motions and changing illumination. In contrast, oriented to general scenarios, our approach additionally tightly fuses LiDAR, IMU, and camera for robust pose estimation and photo-realistic online mapping. To compensate for regions unobserved by the LiDAR, we propose to integrate both the triangulated visual points from images and LiDAR points for initializing 3D Gaussians. In addition, the modeling of the sky and varying camera exposure have been realized for high-quality rendering. Notably, we implement our system purely with C++ and CUDA, and meticulously design a series of strategies to accelerate the online optimization of the Gaussian-based scene representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms its counterparts while maintaining real-time capability. Impressively, regarding photo-realistic mapping, our method with our estimated poses even surpasses all the compared approaches that utilize privileged ground-truth poses for mapping.

| 559 | Direct Learning of Mesh and Appearance via 3D Gaussian Splatting | Ancheng Lin,Jun Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Accurately reconstructing a 3D scene including explicit geometry information is both attractive and challenging. Geometry reconstruction can benefit from incorporating differentiable appearance models, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods encounter efficiency issues due to indirect geometry learning and the paradigm of separately modeling geometry and surface appearance. In this work, we propose a learnable scene model that incorporates 3DGS with an explicit geometry representation, namely a mesh. Our model learns the mesh and appearance in an end-to-end manner, where we bind 3D Gaussians to the mesh faces and perform differentiable rendering of 3DGS to obtain photometric supervision. The model creates an effective information pathway to supervise the learning of both 3DGS and mesh. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned scene model not only achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and rendering quality but also supports manipulation using the explicit mesh. In addition, our model has a unique advantage in adapting to scene updates, thanks to the end-to-end learning of both mesh and appearance.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06945](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06945) |

It also plays an important role in urban planning, architectural design, and the city's promotion, especially in protecting historical and cultural relics. The 3D Gaussian Splatting, due to better performance over NeRF, has become a mainstream technology in 3D reconstruction. Its only input is a set of images but it relies heavily on geometric parameters computed by the SfM process. At the same time, there is an existing abundance of raw 3D models, that could inform the structural perception of certain buildings but cannot be applied. In this paper, we propose a straightforward method to harness these raw 3D models to guide 3D Gaussians in capturing the basic shape of the building and improve the visual quality of textures and details when photos are captured non-systematically.

Leonard,Yogesh Girdhar | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce SeaSplat, a method to enable real-time rendering of underwater scenes leveraging recent advances in 3D radiance fields. Underwater scenes are challenging visual environments, as rendering through a medium such as water introduces both range and color dependent effects on image capture. We constrain 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a recent advance in radiance fields enabling rapid training and real-time rendering of full 3D scenes, with a physically grounded underwater image formation model. Applying SeaSplat to the real-world scenes from SeaThru-NeRF dataset, a scene collected by an underwater vehicle in the US Virgin Islands, and simulation-degraded real-world scenes, not only do we see increased quantitative performance on rendering novel viewpoints from the scene with the medium present, but are also able to recover the underlying true color of the scene and restore renders to be without the presence of the intervening medium. We show that the underwater image formation helps learn scene structure, with better depth maps, as well as show that our improvements maintain the significant computational improvements afforded by leveraging a 3D Gaussian representation.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17345](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17345) |

Existing methods, which rely on SDS optimization or single-view inpainting, often struggle to produce high-quality results. To address this, we propose a novel method for object insertion in 3D content represented by Gaussian Splatting. Our approach introduces a multi-view diffusion model, dubbed MVInpainter, which is built upon a pre-trained stable video diffusion model to facilitate view-consistent object inpainting. Within MVInpainter, we incorporate a ControlNet-based conditional injection module to enable controlled and more predictable multi-view generation. After generating the multi-view inpainted results, we further propose a mask-aware 3D reconstruction technique to refine Gaussian Splatting reconstruction from these sparse inpainted views. By leveraging these fabricate techniques, our approach yields diverse results, ensures view-consistent and harmonious insertions, and produces better object quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16938](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16938) |

Skinner,Ram Vasudevan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have transformed the field of computer vision by enabling photo-realistic representation of complex scenes. Despite this success, they have seen only limited use in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. Two key factors have contributed to this limited success. First, it is challenging to reason about collisions in radiance models. Second, it is difficult to perform inference of radiance models fast enough for real-time trajectory synthesis. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer that operates in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method for rigorously upper-bounding the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Second, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables the efficient computation of the collision bound in a Gaussian Splat. Third, a method is presented to optimize trajectories while avoiding collisions with a scene represented by a Gaussian Splat. Experiments demonstrate that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in highly cluttered environments. The proposed system is also tested on a real-world robot manipulator.

| 552 | Identifying Unnecessary 3D Gaussians using Clustering for Fast Rendering of 3D Gaussian Splatting | Joongho Jo,Hyeongwon Kim,Jongsun Park | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) is a new rendering approach that outperforms the neural radiance field (NeRF) in terms of both speed and image quality. 3D-GS represents 3D scenes by utilizing millions of 3D Gaussians and projects these Gaussians onto the 2D image plane for rendering. However, during the rendering process, a substantial number of unnecessary 3D Gaussians exist for the current view direction, resulting in significant computation costs associated with their identification. In this paper, we propose a computational reduction technique that quickly identifies unnecessary 3D Gaussians in real-time for rendering the current view without compromising image quality. This is accomplished through the offline clustering of 3D Gaussians that are close in distance, followed by the projection of these clusters onto a 2D image plane during runtime. Additionally, we analyze the bottleneck associated with the proposed technique when executed on GPUs and propose an efficient hardware architecture that seamlessly supports the proposed scheme. For the Mip-NeRF360 dataset, the proposed technique excludes 63% of 3D Gaussians on average before the 2D image projection, which reduces the overall rendering computation by almost 38.3% without sacrificing peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR). The proposed accelerator also achieves a speedup of 10.7x compared to a GPU.</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13827](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13827) |
| 551 | Low Latency Point Cloud Rendering with Learned Splatting | Yueyu Hu,Ran Gong,Qi Sun,Yao Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Point cloud is a critical 3D representation with many emerging applications. Because of the point sparsity and irregularity, high-quality rendering of point clouds is challenging and often requires complex computations to recover the continuous surface representation. On the other hand, to avoid visual discomfort, the motion-to-photon latency has to be very short, under 10 ms. Existing rendering solutions lack in either quality or speed. To tackle these challenges, we present a framework that unlocks interactive, free-viewing and high-fidelity point cloud rendering. We train a generic neural network to estimate 3D elliptical Gaussians from arbitrary point clouds and use differentiable surface splatting to render smooth texture and surface normal for arbitrary views. Our approach does not require per-scene optimization, and enable real-time rendering of dynamic point cloud. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed solution enjoys superior visual quality and speed, as well as generalizability to different scene content and robustness to compression artifacts.

To address these challenges, we utilize recent advancements in novel view synthesis, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), to enhance localization. 3DGS allows for the compact encoding of both 3D geometry and scene appearance with its spatial features. Our method leverages the dense description maps produced by XFeat's lightweight keypoint detection and description model. We propose distilling these dense keypoint descriptors into 3DGS to improve the model's spatial understanding, leading to more accurate camera pose predictions through 2D-3D correspondences.

Li,Pierre-Yves Lajoie,Giovanni Beltrame | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Three-dimensional reconstruction is a fundamental problem in robotics perception. We examine the problem of active view selection to perform 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstructions with as few input images as possible. Although 3D Gaussian Splatting has made significant progress in image rendering and 3D reconstruction, the quality of the reconstruction is strongly impacted by the selection of 2D images and the estimation of camera poses through Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms. Current methods to select views that rely on uncertainties from occlusions, depth ambiguities, or neural network predictions directly are insufficient to handle the issue and struggle to generalize to new scenes. By ranking the potential views in the frequency domain, we are able to effectively estimate the potential information gain of new viewpoints without ground truth data. By overcoming current constraints on model architecture and efficacy, our method achieves state-of-the-art results in view selection, demonstrating its potential for efficient image-based 3D reconstruction.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16470](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16470) |

For tackling the scalability issue, we split the large scene into multiple cells, and the candidate point-cloud and camera views of each cell are correlated through a visibility-based camera selection and a progressive point-cloud extension. To reinforce the rendering quality, three highlighted improvements are made in comparison with vanilla 3DGS, which are a strategy of the ray-Gaussian intersection and the novel Gaussians density control for learning efficiency, an appearance decoupling module based on ConvKAN network to solve uneven lighting conditions in large-scale scenes, and a refined final loss with the color loss, the depth distortion loss, and the normal consistency loss. Finally, the seamless stitching procedure is executed to merge the individual Gaussian radiance field for novel view synthesis across different cells. Evaluation of Mill19, Urban3D, and MatrixCity datasets shows that our method consistently generates more high-fidelity rendering results than state-of-the-art methods of large-scale scene reconstruction.

A core requirement is an efficient architecture that scales well to large-scale datasets and large image resolutions. Unfortunately, existing 3D GANs struggle to scale to generate samples at high resolutions due to their relatively slow train and render speeds, and typically have to rely on 2D superresolution networks at the expense of global 3D consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Generative Gaussian Heads (GGHead), which adopts the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting representation within a 3D GAN framework. To generate a 3D representation, we employ a powerful 2D CNN generator to predict Gaussian attributes in the UV space of a template head mesh. This way, GGHead exploits the regularity of the template's UV layout, substantially facilitating the challenging task of predicting an unstructured set of 3D Gaussians. We further improve the geometric fidelity of the generated 3D representations with a novel total variation loss on rendered UV coordinates. Intuitively, this regularization encourages that neighboring rendered pixels should stem from neighboring Gaussians in the template's UV space. Taken together, our pipeline can efficiently generate 3D heads trained only from single-view 2D image observations. Our proposed framework matches the quality of existing 3D head GANs on FFHQ while being both substantially faster and fully 3D consistent. As a result, we demonstrate real-time generation and rendering of high-quality 3D-consistent heads at $1024^2$ resolution for the first time.

However, GS-created 3D environments are often difficult to edit. For scene enhancement or to incorporate 3D assets, segmenting Gaussians by class is essential. Existing segmentation approaches are typically limited to certain types of scenes, e.g., ''circular'' scenes, to determine clear object boundaries. However, this method is ineffective when removing large objects in non-''circling'' scenes such as large outdoor scenes. We propose Semantics-Controlled GS (SCGS), a segmentation-driven GS approach, enabling the separation of large scene parts in uncontrolled, natural environments. SCGS allows scene editing and the extraction of scene parts for VR. Additionally, we introduce a challenging outdoor dataset, overcoming the ''circling'' setup. We outperform the state-of-the-art in visual quality on our dataset and in segmentation quality on the 3D-OVS dataset. We conducted an exploratory user study, comparing a 360-video, plain GS, and SCGS in VR with a fixed viewpoint. In our subsequent main study, users were allowed to move freely, evaluating plain GS and SCGS. Our main study results show that participants clearly prefer SCGS over plain GS. We overall present an innovative approach that surpasses the state-of-the-art both technically and in user experience.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15959](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15959) |
| 545 | Deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting | Byeonghyeon Lee,Howoong Lee,Xiangyu Sun,Usman Ali,Eunbyung Park | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent studies in Radiance Fields have paved the robust way for novel view synthesis with their photorealistic rendering quality. Nevertheless, they usually employ neural networks and volumetric rendering, which are costly to train and impede their broad use in various real-time applications due to the lengthy rendering time. Lately 3D Gaussians splatting-based approach has been proposed to model the 3D scene, and it achieves remarkable visual quality while rendering the images in real-time. However, it suffers from severe degradation in the rendering quality if the training images are blurry. Blurriness commonly occurs due to the lens defocusing, object motion, and camera shake, and it inevitably intervenes in clean image acquisition. Several previous studies have attempted to render clean and sharp images from blurry input images using neural fields. The majority of those works, however, are designed only for volumetric rendering-based neural radiance fields and are not straightforwardly applicable to rasterization-based 3D Gaussian splatting methods. Thus, we propose a novel real-time deblurring framework, Deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting, using a small Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that manipulates the covariance of each 3D Gaussian to model the scene blurriness. While Deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting can still enjoy real-time rendering, it can reconstruct fine and sharp details from blurry images. A variety of experiments have been conducted on the benchmark, and the results have revealed the effectiveness of our approach for deblurring.

| 544 | Plenoptic PNG: Real-Time Neural Radiance Fields in 150 KB | Jae Yong Lee,Yuqun Wu,Chuhang Zou,Derek Hoiem,Shenlong Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The goal of this paper is to encode a 3D scene into an extremely compact representation from 2D images and to enable its transmittance, decoding and rendering in real-time across various platforms. Despite the progress in NeRFs and Gaussian Splats, their large model size and specialized renderers make it challenging to distribute free-viewpoint 3D content as easily as images. To address this, we have designed a novel 3D representation that encodes the plenoptic function into sinusoidal function indexed dense volumes. This approach facilitates feature sharing across different locations, improving compactness over traditional spatial voxels. The memory footprint of the dense 3D feature grid can be further reduced using spatial decomposition techniques. This design combines the strengths of spatial hashing functions and voxel decomposition, resulting in a model size as small as 150 KB for each 3D scene. Moreover, PPNG features a lightweight rendering pipeline with only 300 lines of code that decodes its representation into standard GL textures and fragment shaders. This enables real-time rendering using the traditional GL pipeline, ensuring universal compatibility and efficiency across various platforms without additional dependencies.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15689](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15689) |

Given a short monocular video sequence and a written instruction about the avatar style, our model can generate a high-fidelity toonified avatar that can be driven in real-time by another video with arbitrary identities. Existing related works heavily rely on multi-view modeling to recover geometry via texture embeddings, presented in a static manner, leading to control limitations. The multi-view video input also makes it difficult to deploy these models in real-world applications. To address these issues, we adopt a conditional embedding Tri-plane to learn realistic and stylized facial representations in a Gaussian deformation field. Additionally, we expand the stylization capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting by introducing an adaptive pixel-translation neural network and leveraging patch-aware contrastive learning to achieve high-quality images. To push our work into consumer applications, we develop a real-time system that can operate at 48 FPS on a GPU machine and 15-18 FPS on a mobile machine. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in generating textual avatars over existing methods in terms of quality and real-time animation.

| 542 | Human Hair Reconstruction with Strand-Aligned 3D Gaussians | Egor Zakharov,Vanessa Sklyarova,Michael Black,Giljoo Nam,Justus Thies,Otmar Hilliges | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce a new hair modeling method that uses a dual representation of classical hair strands and 3D Gaussians to produce accurate and realistic strand-based reconstructions from multi-view data. In contrast to recent approaches that leverage unstructured Gaussians to model human avatars, our method reconstructs the hair using 3D polylines, or strands. This fundamental difference allows the use of the resulting hairstyles out-of-the-box in modern computer graphics engines for editing, rendering, and simulation. Our 3D lifting method relies on unstructured Gaussians to generate multi-view ground truth data to supervise the fitting of hair strands. The hairstyle itself is represented in the form of the so-called strand-aligned 3D Gaussians. This representation allows us to combine strand-based hair priors, which are essential for realistic modeling of the inner structure of hairstyles, with the differentiable rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our method, named Gaussian Haircut, is evaluated on synthetic and real scenes and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in the task of strand-based hair reconstruction.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14778](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14778) |
| 541 | UniBEVFusion: Unified Radar-Vision BEVFusion for 3D Object Detection | Haocheng Zhao,Runwei Guan,Taoyu Wu,Ka Lok Man,Limin Yu,Yutao Yue | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>4D millimeter-wave (MMW) radar, which provides both height information and dense point cloud data over 3D MMW radar, has become increasingly popular in 3D object detection. In recent years, radar-vision fusion models have demonstrated performance close to that of LiDAR-based models, offering advantages in terms of lower hardware costs and better resilience in extreme conditions. However, many radar-vision fusion models treat radar as a sparse LiDAR, underutilizing radar-specific information. Additionally, these multi-modal networks are often sensitive to the failure of a single modality, particularly vision. To address these challenges, we propose the Radar Depth Lift-Splat-Shoot (RDL) module, which integrates radar-specific data into the depth prediction process, enhancing the quality of visual Bird-Eye View (BEV) features. We further introduce a Unified Feature Fusion (UFF) approach that extracts BEV features across different modalities using shared module. To assess the robustness of multi-modal models, we develop a novel Failure Test (FT) ablation experiment, which simulates vision modality failure by injecting Gaussian noise. We conduct extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4D datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed Unified BEVFusion (UniBEVFusion) network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on the TJ4D dataset, with improvements of 1.44 in 3D and 1.72 in BEV object detection accuracy.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14751](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14751) |

However, extending 3DGS to large-scale scenes remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel 3DGS-based method for large-scale surface reconstruction using aerial multi-view stereo (MVS) images, named Aerial Gaussian Splatting (AGS). First, we introduce a data chunking method tailored for large-scale aerial images, making 3DGS feasible for surface reconstruction over extensive scenes. Second, we integrate the Ray-Gaussian Intersection method into 3DGS to obtain depth and normal information. Finally, we implement multi-view geometric consistency constraints to enhance the geometric consistency across different views. Our experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate, for the first time, the 3DGS-based method can match conventional aerial MVS methods on geometric accuracy in aerial large-scale surface reconstruction, and our method also beats state-of-the-art GS-based methods both on geometry and rendering quality.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00381](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00381) |
| 539 | Unified Gaussian Primitives for Scene Representation and Rendering | Yang Zhou,Songyin Wu,Ling-Qi Yan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Searching for a unified scene representation remains a research challenge in computer graphics. Traditional mesh-based representations are unsuitable for dense, fuzzy elements, and introduce additional complexity for filtering and differentiable rendering. Conversely, voxel-based representations struggle to model hard surfaces and suffer from intensive memory requirement. We propose a general-purpose rendering primitive based on 3D Gaussian distribution for unified scene representation, featuring versatile appearance ranging from glossy surfaces to fuzzy elements, as well as physically based scattering to enable accurate global illumination. We formulate the rendering theory for the primitive based on non-exponential transport and derive efficient rendering operations to be compatible with Monte Carlo path tracing. The new representation can be converted from different sources, including meshes and 3D Gaussian splatting, and further refined via transmittance optimization thanks to its differentiability. We demonstrate the versatility of our representation in various rendering applications such as global illumination and appearance editing, while supporting arbitrary lighting conditions by nature. Additionally, we compare our representation to existing volumetric representations, highlighting its efficiency to reproduce details.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09733](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09733) |
| 538 | MVPGS: Excavating Multi-view Priors for Gaussian Splatting from Sparse Input Views | Wangze Xu,Huachen Gao,Shihe Shen,Rui Peng,Jianbo Jiao,Ronggang Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) advancement has facilitated few-shot Novel View Synthesis (NVS), which is a significant challenge in 3D vision applications. Despite numerous attempts to reduce the dense input requirement in NeRF, it still suffers from time-consumed training and rendering processes. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time high-quality rendering with an explicit point-based representation. However, similar to NeRF, it tends to overfit the train views for lack of constraints. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{MVPGS}, a few-shot NVS method that excavates the multi-view priors based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. We leverage the recent learning-based Multi-view Stereo (MVS) to enhance the quality of geometric initialization for 3DGS. To mitigate overfitting, we propose a forward-warping method for additional appearance constraints conforming to scenes based on the computed geometry. Furthermore, we introduce a view-consistent geometry constraint for Gaussian parameters to facilitate proper optimization convergence and utilize a monocular depth regularization as compensation. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time rendering speed.

However, most existing approaches can not perform novel view rendering and require large storage capacities for maps. To overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient visual localization method capable of high-quality rendering with fewer parameters. Specifically, our approach leverages 3D Gaussian primitives as the scene representation. To ensure precise 2D-3D correspondences for pose estimation, we develop an unbiased 3D scene-specific descriptor decoder for Gaussian primitives, distilled from a constructed feature volume. Additionally, we introduce a salient 3D landmark selection algorithm that selects a suitable primitive subset based on the saliency score for localization. We further regularize key Gaussian primitives to prevent anisotropic effects, which also improves localization performance. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior or comparable rendering and localization performance to state-of-the-art implicit-based visual localization approaches.

To overcome this, we propose the Avatar Concept Slider (ACS), a 3D avatar editing method that allows precise manipulation of semantic concepts in human avatars towards a specified intermediate point between two extremes of concepts, akin to moving a knob along a slider track. To achieve this, our ACS has three designs. 1) A Concept Sliding Loss based on Linear Discriminant Analysis to pinpoint the concept-specific axis for precise editing. 2) An Attribute Preserving Loss based on Principal Component Analysis for improved preservation of avatar identity during editing. 3) A 3D Gaussian Splatting primitive selection mechanism based on concept-sensitivity, which updates only the primitives that are the most sensitive to our target concept, to improve efficiency. Results demonstrate that our ACS enables fine-grained 3D avatar editing with efficient feedback, without harming the avatar quality or compromising the avatar's identifying attributes.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13995](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13995) |
| 535 | Elite-EvGS: Learning Event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting by Distilling Event-to-Video Priors | Zixin Zhang,Kanghao Chen,Lin Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that output asynchronous and sparse event streams, instead of fixed frames. Benefiting from their distinct advantages, such as high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, event cameras have been applied to address 3D reconstruction, important for robotic mapping. Recently, neural rendering techniques, such as 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have been shown successful in 3D reconstruction. However, it still remains under-explored how to develop an effective event-based 3DGS pipeline. In particular, as 3DGS typically depends on high-quality initialization and dense multiview constraints, a potential problem appears for the 3DGS optimization with events given its inherent sparse property. To this end, we propose a novel event-based 3DGS framework, named Elite-EvGS. Our key idea is to distill the prior knowledge from the off-the-shelf event-to-video (E2V) models to effectively reconstruct 3D scenes from events in a coarse-to-fine optimization manner. Specifically, to address the complexity of 3DGS initialization from events, we introduce a novel warm-up initialization strategy that optimizes a coarse 3DGS from the frames generated by E2V models and then incorporates events to refine the details. Then, we propose a progressive event supervision strategy that employs the window-slicing operation to progressively reduce the number of events used for supervision. This subtly relives the temporal randomness of the event frames, benefiting the optimization of local textural and global structural details. Experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that Elite-EvGS can reconstruct 3D scenes with better textural and structural details. Meanwhile, our method yields plausible performance on the captured real-world data, including diverse challenging conditions, such as fast motion and low light scenes.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13392](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13392) |

However, copyright protection for the 3D Gaussian splatting has not yet been introduced. In this paper, we present a novel watermarking method for 3D Gaussian splatting. The proposed method embeds a binary message into 3D Gaussians by fine-tuning the pre-trained 3D Gaussian splatting model. To achieve this, we present Frequency-Guided Densification (FGD) that utilizes Discrete Fourier Transform to find patches with high-frequencies and split 3D Gaussians based on 3D Gaussian Contribution Vector. It is each 3D Gaussian contribution to rendered pixel colors, improving both rendering quality and bit accuracy. Furthermore, we modify an adaptive gradient mask to enhance rendering quality. Our experiments show that our method can embed a watermark in 3D Gaussians imperceptibly with increased capacity and robustness against attacks.

Zelek | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Real-time SLAM with dense 3D mapping is computationally challenging, especially on resource-limited devices. The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising approach for real-time dense 3D reconstruction. However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems struggle to balance hardware simplicity, speed, and map quality. Most systems excel in one or two of the aforementioned aspects but rarely achieve all. A key issue is the difficulty of initializing 3D Gaussians while concurrently conducting SLAM. To address these challenges, we present Monocular GSO (MGSO), a novel real-time SLAM system that integrates photometric SLAM with 3DGS. Photometric SLAM provides dense structured point clouds for 3DGS initialization, accelerating optimization and producing more efficient maps with fewer Gaussians. As a result, experiments show that our system generates reconstructions with a balance of quality, memory efficiency, and speed that outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our system achieves all results using RGB inputs. We evaluate the Replica, TUM-RGBD, and EuRoC datasets against current live dense reconstruction systems. Not only do we surpass contemporary systems, but experiments also show that we maintain our performance on laptop hardware, making it a practical solution for robotics, A/R, and other real-time applications.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13055](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13055) |

However, they frequently exhibit shortcomings such as over-saturated color and excess smoothness. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of SDS and refine its formulation, finding that the core design is to model the distribution of rendered images. Following this insight, we introduce a novel strategy called Variational Distribution Mapping (VDM), which expedites the distribution modeling process by regarding the rendered images as instances of degradation from diffusion-based generation. This special design enables the efficient training of variational distribution by skipping the calculations of the Jacobians in the diffusion U-Net. We also introduce timestep-dependent Distribution Coefficient Annealing (DCA) to further improve distilling precision. Leveraging VDM and DCA, we use Gaussian Splatting as the 3D representation and build a text-to-3D generation framework. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate the capability of VDM and DCA to generate high-fidelity and realistic assets with optimization efficiency.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05099](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05099) |

However, ensuring geometric accuracy in outdoor and unbounded scenes remains a significant challenge. This study introduces LI-GS, a reconstruction system that incorporates LiDAR and Gaussian Splatting to enhance geometric accuracy in large-scale scenes. 2D Gaussain surfels are employed as the map representation to enhance surface alignment. Additionally, a novel modeling method is proposed to convert LiDAR point clouds to plane-constrained multimodal Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). The GMMs are utilized during both initialization and optimization stages to ensure sufficient and continuous supervision over the entire scene while mitigating the risk of over-fitting. Furthermore, GMMs are employed in mesh extraction to eliminate artifacts and improve the overall geometric quality.

Existing methods reduce the optimization time by decreasing the number of Gaussians or by improving the implementation of the differentiable rasterizer. However, they still rely on the ADAM optimizer to fit Gaussian parameters of a scene in thousands of iterations, which can take up to an hour. To this end, we change the optimizer to LM that runs in conjunction with the 3DGS differentiable rasterizer. For efficient GPU parallization, we propose a caching data structure for intermediate gradients that allows us to efficiently calculate Jacobian-vector products in custom CUDA kernels. In every LM iteration, we calculate update directions from multiple image subsets using these kernels and combine them in a weighted mean. Overall, our method is 30% faster than the original 3DGS while obtaining the same reconstruction quality. Our optimization is also agnostic to other methods that acclerate 3DGS, thus enabling even faster speedups compared to vanilla 3DGS.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12892](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12892) |
| 529 | EdgeGaussians -- 3D Edge Mapping via Gaussian Splatting | Kunal Chelani,Assia Benbihi,Torsten Sattler,Fredrik Kahl | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>With their meaningful geometry and their omnipresence in the 3D world, edges are extremely useful primitives in computer vision. 3D edges comprise of lines and curves, and methods to reconstruct them use either multi-view images or point clouds as input. State-of-the-art image-based methods first learn a 3D edge point cloud then fit 3D edges to it. The edge point cloud is obtained by learning a 3D neural implicit edge field from which the 3D edge points are sampled on a specific level set (0 or 1). However, such methods present two important drawbacks: i) it is not realistic to sample points on exact level sets due to float imprecision and training inaccuracies. Instead, they are sampled within a range of levels so the points do not lie accurately on the 3D edges and require further processing. ii) Such implicit representations are computationally expensive and require long training times. In this paper, we address these two limitations and propose a 3D edge mapping that is simpler, more efficient, and preserves accuracy. Our method learns explicitly the 3D edge points and their edge direction hence bypassing the need for point sampling. It casts a 3D edge point as the center of a 3D Gaussian and the edge direction as the principal axis of the Gaussian. Such a representation has the advantage of being not only geometrically meaningful but also compatible with the efficient training optimization defined in Gaussian Splatting. Results show that the proposed method produces edges as accurate and complete as the state-of-the-art while being an order of magnitude faster.

Driving scene images from vehicle-mounted cameras are typically sparse, with limited overlap, and the movement of the vehicle further complicates the acquisition of camera extrinsics. To tackle these challenges and achieve real-time reconstruction, we jointly train a pose network, a depth network, and a Gaussian network to predict the Gaussian primitives that represent the driving scenes. The pose network and depth network determine the position of the Gaussian primitives in a self-supervised manner, without using depth ground truth and camera extrinsics during training. The Gaussian network independently predicts primitive parameters from each input image, including covariance, opacity, and spherical harmonics coefficients. At the inference stage, our model can achieve feed-forward reconstruction from flexible multi-frame surround-view input. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art feed-forward and scene-optimized reconstruction methods in terms of reconstruction.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12753](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12753) |

Estimating the structure and motion of unknown objects in dynamic environments is fundamental for such autonomous systems. Traditionally, the solutions have relied on prior knowledge of target objects, multiple disparate representations, or low-fidelity outputs unsuitable for robotic operations. This work proposes a novel approach to incrementally reconstruct and track a dynamic unknown object using a unified representation -- a set of 3D Gaussian blobs that describe its geometry and appearance. The differentiable 3D Gaussian Splatting framework is adapted to a dynamic object-centric setting. The input to the pipeline is a sequential set of RGB-D images. 3D reconstruction and 6-DoF pose tracking tasks are tackled using first-order gradient-based optimization. The formulation is simple, requires no pre-training, assumes no prior knowledge of the object or its motion, and is suitable for online applications. The proposed approach is validated on a dataset of 10 unknown spacecraft of diverse geometry and texture under arbitrary relative motion. The experiments demonstrate successful 3D reconstruction and accurate 6-DoF tracking of the target object in proximity operations over a short to medium duration. The causes of tracking drift are discussed and potential solutions are outlined.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20104](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20104) |
| 525 | Depth Estimation Based on 3D Gaussian Splatting Siamese Defocus | Jinchang Zhang,Ningning Xu,Hao Zhang,Guoyu Lu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D geometry. While stereo depth estimation can be achieved through triangulation methods, it is not as straightforward for monocular methods, which require the integration of global and local information. The Depth from Defocus (DFD) method utilizes camera lens models and parameters to recover depth information from blurred images and has been proven to perform well. However, these methods rely on All-In-Focus (AIF) images for depth estimation, which is nearly impossible to obtain in real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised framework based on 3D Gaussian splatting and Siamese networks. By learning the blur levels at different focal distances of the same scene in the focal stack, the framework predicts the defocus map and Circle of Confusion (CoC) from a single defocused image, using the defocus map as input to DepthNet for monocular depth estimation. The 3D Gaussian splatting model renders defocused images using the predicted CoC, and the differences between these and the real defocused images provide additional supervision signals for the Siamese Defocus self-supervised network. This framework has been validated on both artificially synthesized and real blurred datasets. Subsequent quantitative and visualization experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework is highly effective as a DFD method.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12323](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12323) |

To address this, we present Vista3D, a framework that realizes swift and consistent 3D generation within a mere 5 minutes. At the heart of Vista3D lies a two-phase approach: the coarse phase and the fine phase. In the coarse phase, we rapidly generate initial geometry with Gaussian Splatting from a single image. In the fine phase, we extract a Signed Distance Function (SDF) directly from learned Gaussian Splatting, optimizing it with a differentiable isosurface representation. Furthermore, it elevates the quality of generation by using a disentangled representation with two independent implicit functions to capture both visible and obscured aspects of objects. Additionally, it harmonizes gradients from 2D diffusion prior with 3D-aware diffusion priors by angular diffusion prior composition. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that Vista3D effectively sustains a balance between the consistency and diversity of the generated 3D objects.

| 523 | LM-Gaussian: Boost Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting with Large Model Priors | Hanyang Yu,Xiaoxiao Long,Ping Tan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We aim to address sparse-view reconstruction of a 3D scene by leveraging priors from large-scale vision models. While recent advancements such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable successes in 3D reconstruction, these methods typically necessitate hundreds of input images that densely capture the underlying scene, making them time-consuming and impractical for real-world applications. However, sparse-view reconstruction is inherently ill-posed and under-constrained, often resulting in inferior and incomplete outcomes. This is due to issues such as failed initialization, overfitting on input images, and a lack of details. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce LM-Gaussian, a method capable of generating high-quality reconstructions from a limited number of images. Specifically, we propose a robust initialization module that leverages stereo priors to aid in the recovery of camera poses and the reliable point clouds. Additionally, a diffusion-based refinement is iteratively applied to incorporate image diffusion priors into the Gaussian optimization process to preserve intricate scene details. Finally, we utilize video diffusion priors to further enhance the rendered images for realistic visual effects. Overall, our approach significantly reduces the data acquisition requirements compared to previous 3DGS methods.

Conventional Structure from Motion (SfM) methods for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction often fail in these environments due to poor correspondence construction. To address these challenges, we introduce LetsGo, a LiDAR-assisted Gaussian splatting framework for large-scale garage modeling and rendering. We develop a handheld scanner, Polar, equipped with IMU, LiDAR, and a fisheye camera, to facilitate accurate data acquisition. Using this Polar device, we present the GarageWorld dataset, consisting of eight expansive garage scenes with diverse geometric structures, which will be made publicly available for further research. Our approach demonstrates that LiDAR point clouds collected by the Polar device significantly enhance a suite of 3D Gaussian splatting algorithms for garage scene modeling and rendering. We introduce a novel depth regularizer that effectively eliminates floating artifacts in rendered images. Additionally, we propose a multi-resolution 3D Gaussian representation designed for Level-of-Detail (LOD) rendering. This includes adapted scaling factors for individual levels and a random-resolution-level training scheme to optimize the Gaussians across different resolutions. This representation enables efficient rendering of large-scale garage scenes on lightweight devices via a web-based renderer. Experimental results on our GarageWorld dataset, as well as on ScanNet++ and KITTI-360, demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of rendering quality and resource efficiency.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09748](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09748) |

Recently, targetless calibration techniques based on implicit neural representations have proven to provide precise and robust results. Nevertheless, such methods are inherently slow to train given the high computational overhead caused by the large number of sampled points required for volume rendering. With the recent introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting as a faster alternative to implicit representation methods, we propose to leverage this new rendering approach to achieve faster multi-sensor calibration. We introduce 3DGS-Calib, a new calibration method that relies on the speed and rendering accuracy of 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve multimodal spatiotemporal calibration that is accurate, robust, and with a substantial speed-up compared to methods relying on implicit neural representations. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposal with experimental results on sequences from KITTI-360, a widely used driving dataset.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11577](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11577) |
| 520 | Gradient-Driven 3D Segmentation and Affordance Transfer in Gaussian Splatting Using 2D Masks | Joji Joseph,Bharadwaj Amrutur,Shalabh Bhatnagar | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful 3D scene representation technique, capturing fine details with high efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel voting-based method that extends 2D segmentation models to 3D Gaussian splats. Our approach leverages masked gradients, where gradients are filtered by input 2D masks, and these gradients are used as votes to achieve accurate segmentation. As a byproduct, we discovered that inference-time gradients can also be used to prune Gaussians, resulting in up to 21% compression. Additionally, we explore few-shot affordance transfer, allowing annotations from 2D images to be effectively transferred onto 3D Gaussian splats. The robust yet straightforward mathematical formulation underlying this approach makes it a highly effective tool for numerous downstream applications, such as augmented reality (AR), object editing, and robotics.

| 519 | GaussianObject: High-Quality 3D Object Reconstruction from Four Views with Gaussian Splatting | Chen Yang,Sikuang Li,Jiemin Fang,Ruofan Liang,Lingxi Xie,Xiaopeng Zhang,Wei Shen,Qi Tian | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing and rendering 3D objects from highly sparse views is of critical importance for promoting applications of 3D vision techniques and improving user experience. However, images from sparse views only contain very limited 3D information, leading to two significant challenges: 1) Difficulty in building multi-view consistency as images for matching are too few; 2) Partially omitted or highly compressed object information as view coverage is insufficient. To tackle these challenges, we propose GaussianObject, a framework to represent and render the 3D object with Gaussian splatting that achieves high rendering quality with only 4 input images. We first introduce techniques of visual hull and floater elimination, which explicitly inject structure priors into the initial optimization process to help build multi-view consistency, yielding a coarse 3D Gaussian representation. Then we construct a Gaussian repair model based on diffusion models to supplement the omitted object information, where Gaussians are further refined. We design a self-generating strategy to obtain image pairs for training the repair model. We further design a COLMAP-free variant, where pre-given accurate camera poses are not required, which achieves competitive quality and facilitates wider applications. GaussianObject is evaluated on several challenging datasets, including MipNeRF360, OmniObject3D, OpenIllumination, and our-collected unposed images, achieving superior performance from only four views and significantly outperforming previous SOTA methods.</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10259](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10259) |

To achieve a economical and robust purely visual autonomous driving system, we propose RenderWorld, a vision-only end-to-end autonomous driving framework, which generates 3D occupancy labels using a self-supervised gaussian-based Img2Occ Module, then encodes the labels by AM-VAE, and uses world model for forecasting and planning. RenderWorld employs Gaussian Splatting to represent 3D scenes and render 2D images greatly improves segmentation accuracy and reduces GPU memory consumption compared with NeRF-based methods. By applying AM-VAE to encode air and non-air separately, RenderWorld achieves more fine-grained scene element representation, leading to state-of-the-art performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and motion planning from autoregressive world model.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11356](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11356) |

Esat Kalfaoglu,Halil Ibrahim Ozturk,Ozsel Kilinc,Alptekin Temizel | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, the centerline has become a popular representation of lanes due to its advantages in solving the road topology problem. To enhance centerline prediction, we have developed a new approach called TopoMask. Unlike previous methods that rely on keypoints or parametric methods, TopoMask utilizes an instance-mask-based formulation coupled with a masked-attention-based transformer architecture. We introduce a quad-direction label representation to enrich the mask instances with flow information and design a corresponding post-processing technique for mask-to-centerline conversion. Additionally, we demonstrate that the instance-mask formulation provides complementary information to parametric Bezier regressions, and fusing both outputs leads to improved detection and topology performance. Moreover, we analyze the shortcomings of the pillar assumption in the Lift Splat technique and adapt a multi-height bin configuration. Experimental results show that TopoMask achieves state-of-the-art performance in the OpenLane-V2 dataset, increasing from 44.1 to 49.4 for Subset-A and 44.7 to 51.8 for Subset-B in the V1.1 OLS baseline.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11325](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11325) |

However, 3DGS models typically overfit to single-scene training and are highly sensitive to the initialization of Gaussian ellipsoids, heuristically derived from Structure from Motion (SfM) point clouds, which limits both generalization and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose GS-Net, a generalizable, plug-and-play 3DGS module that densifies Gaussian ellipsoids from sparse SfM point clouds, enhancing geometric structure representation. To the best of our knowledge, GS-Net is the first plug-and-play 3DGS module with cross-scene generalization capabilities. Additionally, we introduce the CARLA-NVS dataset, which incorporates additional camera viewpoints to thoroughly evaluate reconstruction and rendering quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that applying GS-Net to 3DGS yields a PSNR improvement of 2.08 dB for conventional viewpoints and 1.86 dB for novel viewpoints, confirming the method's effectiveness and robustness.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11307](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11307) |

We propose a Real2Sim pipeline with a hybrid representation model that integrates mesh geometry, 3D Gaussian kernels, and physics attributes to enhance the digital asset representation of robotic arms.  This hybrid representation is implemented through a Gaussian-Mesh-Pixel binding technique, which establishes an isomorphic mapping between mesh vertices and Gaussian models. This enables a fully differentiable rendering pipeline that can be optimized through numerical solvers, achieves high-fidelity rendering via Gaussian Splatting, and facilitates physically plausible simulation of the robotic arm's interaction with its environment using mesh-based methods.

| 514 | SplatFields: Neural Gaussian Splats for Sparse 3D and 4D Reconstruction | Marko Mihajlovic,Sergey Prokudin,Siyu Tang,Robert Maier,Federica Bogo,Tony Tung,Edmond Boyer | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Digitizing 3D static scenes and 4D dynamic events from multi-view images has long been a challenge in computer vision and graphics. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a practical and scalable reconstruction method, gaining popularity due to its impressive reconstruction quality, real-time rendering capabilities, and compatibility with widely used visualization tools. However, the method requires a substantial number of input views to achieve high-quality scene reconstruction, introducing a significant practical bottleneck. This challenge is especially severe in capturing dynamic scenes, where deploying an extensive camera array can be prohibitively costly. In this work, we identify the lack of spatial autocorrelation of splat features as one of the factors contributing to the suboptimal performance of the 3DGS technique in sparse reconstruction settings. To address the issue, we propose an optimization strategy that effectively regularizes splat features by modeling them as the outputs of a corresponding implicit neural field. This results in a consistent enhancement of reconstruction quality across various scenarios. Our approach effectively handles static and dynamic cases, as demonstrated by extensive testing across different setups and scene complexities.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11211](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11211) |
| 513 | A Diffusion Approach to Radiance Field Relighting using Multi-Illumination Synthesis | Yohan Poirier-Ginter,Alban Gauthier,Julien Philip,Jean-Francois Lalonde,George Drettakis | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Relighting radiance fields is severely underconstrained for multi-view data, which is most often captured under a single illumination condition; It is especially hard for full scenes containing multiple objects. We introduce a method to create relightable radiance fields using such single-illumination data by exploiting priors extracted from 2D image diffusion models. We first fine-tune a 2D diffusion model on a multi-illumination dataset conditioned by light direction, allowing us to augment a single-illumination capture into a realistic -- but possibly inconsistent -- multi-illumination dataset from directly defined light directions. We use this augmented data to create a relightable radiance field represented by 3D Gaussian splats. To allow direct control of light direction for low-frequency lighting, we represent appearance with a multi-layer perceptron parameterized on light direction. To enforce multi-view consistency and overcome inaccuracies we optimize a per-image auxiliary feature vector. We show results on synthetic and real multi-view data under single illumination, demonstrating that our method successfully exploits 2D diffusion model priors to allow realistic 3D relighting for complete scenes.

However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM methods often suffer from accumulated tracking errors and map drift, particularly in large-scale environments. To address these issues, we introduce GLC-SLAM, a Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that integrates global optimization of camera poses and scene models. Our approach employs frame-to-model tracking and triggers hierarchical loop closure using a global-to-local strategy to minimize drift accumulation. By dividing the scene into 3D Gaussian submaps, we facilitate efficient map updates following loop corrections in large scenes. Additionally, our uncertainty-minimized keyframe selection strategy prioritizes keyframes observing more valuable 3D Gaussians to enhance submap optimization. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that GLC-SLAM achieves superior or competitive tracking and mapping performance compared to state-of-the-art dense RGB-D SLAM systems.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10982](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10982) |
| 511 | Phys3DGS: Physically-based 3D Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering | Euntae Choi,Sungjoo Yoo | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose two novel ideas (adoption of deferred rendering and mesh-based representation) to improve the quality of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) based inverse rendering. We first report a problem incurred by hidden Gaussians, where Gaussians beneath the surface adversely affect the pixel color in the volume rendering adopted by the existing methods. In order to resolve the problem, we propose applying deferred rendering and report new problems incurred in a naive application of deferred rendering to the existing 3DGS-based inverse rendering. In an effort to improve the quality of 3DGS-based inverse rendering under deferred rendering, we propose a novel two-step training approach which (1) exploits mesh extraction and utilizes a hybrid mesh-3DGS representation and (2) applies novel regularization methods to better exploit the mesh. Our experiments show that, under relighting, the proposed method offers significantly better rendering quality than the existing 3DGS-based inverse rendering methods. Compared with the SOTA voxel grid-based inverse rendering method, it gives better rendering quality while offering real-time rendering.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10335](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10335) |

| 509 | Adaptive Segmentation-Based Initialization for Steered Mixture of Experts Image Regression | Yi-Hsin Li,Sebastian Knorr,M\xc3\xa5rten Sj\xc3\xb6str\xc3\xb6m,Thomas Sikora | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Kernel image regression methods have shown to provide excellent efficiency in many image processing task, such as image and light-field compression, Gaussian Splatting, denoising and super-resolution. The estimation of parameters for these methods frequently employ gradient descent iterative optimization, which poses significant computational burden for many applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptive segmentation-based initialization method targeted for optimizing Steered-Mixture-of Experts (SMoE) gating networks and Radial-Basis-Function (RBF) networks with steering kernels. The novel initialization method allocates kernels into pre-calculated image segments. The optimal number of kernels, kernel positions, and steering parameters are derived per segment in an iterative optimization and kernel sparsification procedure. The kernel information from "local" segments is then transferred into a "global" initialization, ready for use in iterative optimization of SMoE, RBF, and related kernel image regression methods. Results show that drastic objective and subjective quality improvements are achievable compared to widely used regular grid initialization, "state-of-the-art" K-Means initialization and previously introduced segmentation-based initialization methods, while also drastically improving the sparsity of the regression models. For same quality, the novel initialization results in models with around 50% reduction of kernels. In addition, a significant reduction of convergence time is achieved, with overall run-time savings of up to 50%. The segmentation-based initialization strategy itself admits heavy parallel computation; in theory, it may be divided into as many tasks as there are segments in the images. By accessing only four parallel GPUs, run-time savings of already 50% for initialization are achievable.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10101](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10101) |
| 508 | DENSER: 3D Gaussians Splatting for Scene Reconstruction of Dynamic Urban Environments | Mahmud A. Mohamad,Gamal Elghazaly,Arthur Hubert,Raphael Frank | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper presents DENSER, an efficient and effective approach leveraging 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) for the reconstruction of dynamic urban environments. While several methods for photorealistic scene representations, both implicitly using neural radiance fields (NeRF) and explicitly using 3DGS have shown promising results in scene reconstruction of relatively complex dynamic scenes, modeling the dynamic appearance of foreground objects tend to be challenging, limiting the applicability of these methods to capture subtleties and details of the scenes, especially far dynamic objects. To this end, we propose DENSER, a framework that significantly enhances the representation of dynamic objects and accurately models the appearance of dynamic objects in the driving scene. Instead of directly using Spherical Harmonics (SH) to model the appearance of dynamic objects, we introduce and integrate a new method aiming at dynamically estimating SH bases using wavelets, resulting in better representation of dynamic objects appearance in both space and time. Besides object appearance, DENSER enhances object shape representation through densification of its point cloud across multiple scene frames, resulting in faster convergence of model training. Extensive evaluations on KITTI dataset show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin.

We propose a novel Control Barrier Function (CBF) that not only induces safety with respect to all Gaussian primitives in the scene, but when synthesized into a controller, is capable of processing hundreds of thousands of Gaussians while maintaining a minimal memory footprint and operating at 15 Hz during online Splat training. Of the total compute time, a small fraction of it consumes GPU resources, enabling uninterrupted training. The safety layer is minimally invasive, correcting robot actions only when they are unsafe. To showcase the safety filter, we also introduce SplatBridge, an open-source software package built with ROS for real-time GSplat mapping for robots. We demonstrate the safety and robustness of our pipeline first in simulation, where our method is 20-50x faster, safer, and less conservative than competing methods based on neural radiance fields. Further, we demonstrate simultaneous GSplat mapping and safety filtering on a drone hardware platform using only on-board perception.

Nevertheless, the huge file size of the 3D Gaussians presents challenges for transmission and storage. Current works design compact models to replace the substantial volume and attributes of 3D Gaussians, along with intensive training to distill information. These endeavors demand considerable training time, presenting formidable hurdles for practical deployment. To this end, we propose MesonGS, a codec for post-training compression of 3D Gaussians. Initially, we introduce a measurement criterion that considers both view-dependent and view-independent factors to assess the impact of each Gaussian point on the rendering output, enabling the removal of insignificant points. Subsequently, we decrease the entropy of attributes through two transformations that complement subsequent entropy coding techniques to enhance the file compression rate. More specifically, we first replace rotation quaternions with Euler angles; then, we apply region adaptive hierarchical transform to key attributes to reduce entropy. Lastly, we adopt finer-grained quantization to avoid excessive information loss. Moreover, a well-crafted finetune scheme is devised to restore quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MesonGS significantly reduces the size of 3D Gaussians while preserving competitive quality.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09756](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09756) |
| 505 | GEVO: Memory-Efficient Monocular Visual Odometry Using Gaussians | Dasong Gao,Peter Zhi Xuan Li,Vivienne Sze,Sertac Karaman | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Constructing a high-fidelity representation of the 3D scene using a monocular camera can enable a wide range of applications on mobile devices, such as micro-robots, smartphones, and AR/VR headsets. On these devices, memory is often limited in capacity and its access often dominates the consumption of compute energy. Although Gaussian Splatting (GS) allows for high-fidelity reconstruction of 3D scenes, current GS-based SLAM is not memory efficient as a large number of past images is stored to retrain Gaussians for reducing catastrophic forgetting. These images often require two-orders-of-magnitude higher memory than the map itself and thus dominate the total memory usage. In this work, we present GEVO, a GS-based monocular SLAM framework that achieves comparable fidelity as prior methods by rendering (instead of storing) them from the existing map. Novel Gaussian initialization and optimization techniques are proposed to remove artifacts from the map and delay the degradation of the rendered images over time. Across a variety of environments, GEVO achieves comparable map fidelity while reducing the memory overhead to around 58 MBs, which is up to 94x lower than prior works.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09295](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09295) |

Constructing such avatars is a challenging research problem, due to a high demand for photo-realism and real-time rendering performance. In this work, we propose Neural Parametric Gaussian Avatars (NPGA), a data-driven approach to create high-fidelity, controllable avatars from multi-view video recordings. We build our method around 3D Gaussian splatting for its highly efficient rendering and to inherit the topological flexibility of point clouds. In contrast to previous work, we condition our avatars' dynamics on the rich expression space of neural parametric head models (NPHM), instead of mesh-based 3DMMs. To this end, we distill the backward deformation field of our underlying NPHM into forward deformations which are compatible with rasterization-based rendering. All remaining fine-scale, expression-dependent details are learned from the multi-view videos. For increased representational capacity of our avatars, we propose per-Gaussian latent features that condition each primitives dynamic behavior. To regularize this increased dynamic expressivity, we propose Laplacian terms on the latent features and predicted dynamics. We evaluate our method on the public NeRSemble dataset, demonstrating that NPGA significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art avatars on the self-reenactment task by 2.6 PSNR. Furthermore, we demonstrate accurate animation capabilities from real-world monocular videos.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19331](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19331) |
| 503 | AdR-Gaussian: Accelerating Gaussian Splatting with Adaptive Radius | Xinzhe Wang,Ran Yi,Lizhuang Ma | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a recent explicit 3D representation that has achieved high-quality reconstruction and real-time rendering of complex scenes. However, the rasterization pipeline still suffers from unnecessary overhead resulting from avoidable serial Gaussian culling, and uneven load due to the distinct number of Gaussian to be rendered across pixels, which hinders wider promotion and application of 3DGS. In order to accelerate Gaussian splatting, we propose AdR-Gaussian, which moves part of serial culling in Render stage into the earlier Preprocess stage to enable parallel culling, employing adaptive radius to narrow the rendering pixel range for each Gaussian, and introduces a load balancing method to minimize thread waiting time during the pixel-parallel rendering. Our contributions are threefold, achieving a rendering speed of 310% while maintaining equivalent or even better quality than the state-of-the-art. Firstly, we propose to early cull Gaussian-Tile pairs of low splatting opacity based on an adaptive radius in the Gaussian-parallel Preprocess stage, which reduces the number of affected tile through the Gaussian bounding circle, thus reducing unnecessary overhead and achieving faster rendering speed. Secondly, we further propose early culling based on axis-aligned bounding box for Gaussian splatting, which achieves a more significant reduction in ineffective expenses by accurately calculating the Gaussian size in the 2D directions. Thirdly, we propose a balancing algorithm for pixel thread load, which compresses the information of heavy-load pixels to reduce thread waiting time, and enhance information of light-load pixels to hedge against rendering quality loss. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly improve the Gaussian Splatting rendering speed.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08669](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08669) |
| 502 | Dense Point Clouds Matter: Dust-GS for Scene Reconstruction from Sparse Viewpoints | Shan Chen,Jiale Zhou,Lei Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in scene synthesis and novel view synthesis tasks. Typically, the initialization of 3D Gaussian primitives relies on point clouds derived from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods. However, in scenarios requiring scene reconstruction from sparse viewpoints, the effectiveness of 3DGS is significantly constrained by the quality of these initial point clouds and the limited number of input images. In this study, we present Dust-GS, a novel framework specifically designed to overcome the limitations of 3DGS in sparse viewpoint conditions. Instead of relying solely on SfM, Dust-GS introduces an innovative point cloud initialization technique that remains effective even with sparse input data. Our approach leverages a hybrid strategy that integrates an adaptive depth-based masking technique, thereby enhancing the accuracy and detail of reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that Dust-GS surpasses traditional 3DGS methods in scenarios with sparse viewpoints, achieving superior scene reconstruction quality with a reduced number of input images.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08613](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08613) |
| 501 | DualBEV: Unifying Dual View Transformation with Probabilistic Correspondences | Peidong Li,Wancheng Shen,Qihao Huang,Dixiao Cui | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Camera-based Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perception often struggles between adopting 3D-to-2D or 2D-to-3D view transformation (VT). The 3D-to-2D VT typically employs resource-intensive Transformer to establish robust correspondences between 3D and 2D features, while the 2D-to-3D VT utilizes the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline for real-time application, potentially missing distant information. To address these limitations, we propose DualBEV, a unified framework that utilizes a shared feature transformation incorporating three probabilistic measurements for both strategies.

| 499 | GaussianOcc: Fully Self-supervised and Efficient 3D Occupancy Estimation with Gaussian Splatting | Wanshui Gan,Fang Liu,Hongbin Xu,Ningkai Mo,Naoto Yokoya | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce GaussianOcc, a systematic method that investigates the two usages of Gaussian splatting for fully self-supervised and efficient 3D occupancy estimation in surround views. First, traditional methods for self-supervised 3D occupancy estimation still require ground truth 6D poses from sensors during training. To address this limitation, we propose Gaussian Splatting for Projection (GSP) module to provide accurate scale information for fully self-supervised training from adjacent view projection. Additionally, existing methods rely on volume rendering for final 3D voxel representation learning using 2D signals (depth maps, semantic maps), which is both time-consuming and less effective. We propose Gaussian Splatting from Voxel space (GSV) to leverage the fast rendering properties of Gaussian splatting. As a result, the proposed GaussianOcc method enables fully self-supervised (no ground truth pose) 3D occupancy estimation in competitive performance with low computational cost (2.7 times faster in training and 5 times faster in rendering). The relevant code will be available in https://github.com/GANWANSHUI/GaussianOcc.git.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11447](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11447) |
| 498 | Robust Dual Gaussian Splatting for Immersive Human-centric Volumetric Videos | Yuheng Jiang,Zhehao Shen,Yu Hong,Chengcheng Guo,Yize Wu,Yingliang Zhang,Jingyi Yu,Lan Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Volumetric video represents a transformative advancement in visual media, enabling users to freely navigate immersive virtual experiences and narrowing the gap between digital and real worlds. However, the need for extensive manual intervention to stabilize mesh sequences and the generation of excessively large assets in existing workflows impedes broader adoption. In this paper, we present a novel Gaussian-based approach, dubbed \\textit{DualGS}, for real-time and high-fidelity playback of complex human performance with excellent compression ratios. Our key idea in DualGS is to separately represent motion and appearance using the corresponding skin and joint Gaussians. Such an explicit disentanglement can significantly reduce motion redundancy and enhance temporal coherence. We begin by initializing the DualGS and anchoring skin Gaussians to joint Gaussians at the first frame. Subsequently, we employ a coarse-to-fine training strategy for frame-by-frame human performance modeling. It includes a coarse alignment phase for overall motion prediction as well as a fine-grained optimization for robust tracking and high-fidelity rendering. To integrate volumetric video seamlessly into VR environments, we efficiently compress motion using entropy encoding and appearance using codec compression coupled with a persistent codebook. Our approach achieves a compression ratio of up to 120 times, only requiring approximately 350KB of storage per frame. We demonstrate the efficacy of our representation through photo-realistic, free-view experiences on VR headsets, enabling users to immersively watch musicians in performance and feel the rhythm of the notes at the performers' fingertips.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08353](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08353) |
| 497 | FlashSplat: 2D to 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation Solved Optimally | Qiuhong Shen,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This study addresses the challenge of accurately segmenting 3D Gaussian Splatting from 2D masks. Conventional methods often rely on iterative gradient descent to assign each Gaussian a unique label, leading to lengthy optimization and sub-optimal solutions. Instead, we propose a straightforward yet globally optimal solver for 3D-GS segmentation. The core insight of our method is that, with a reconstructed 3D-GS scene, the rendering of the 2D masks is essentially a linear function with respect to the labels of each Gaussian. As such, the optimal label assignment can be solved via linear programming in closed form. This solution capitalizes on the alpha blending characteristic of the splatting process for single step optimization. By incorporating the background bias in our objective function, our method shows superior robustness in 3D segmentation against noises. Remarkably, our optimization completes within 30 seconds, about 50$\\times$ faster than the best existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method in segmenting various scenes, and its superior performance in downstream tasks such as object removal and inpainting. Demos and code will be available at https://github.com/florinshen/FlashSplat.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08270](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08270) |
| 496 | Thermal3D-GS: Physics-induced 3D Gaussians for Thermal Infrared Novel-view Synthesis | Qian Chen,Shihao Shu,Xiangzhi Bai | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel-view synthesis based on visible light has been extensively studied. In comparison to visible light imaging, thermal infrared imaging offers the advantage of all-weather imaging and strong penetration, providing increased possibilities for reconstruction in nighttime and adverse weather scenarios. However, thermal infrared imaging is influenced by physical characteristics such as atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction, hindering the precise reconstruction of intricate details in thermal infrared scenes, manifesting as issues of floaters and indistinct edge features in synthesized images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a physics-induced 3D Gaussian splatting method named Thermal3D-GS. Thermal3D-GS begins by modeling atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction in three-dimensional media using neural networks. Additionally, a temperature consistency constraint is incorporated into the optimization objective to enhance the reconstruction accuracy of thermal infrared images. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of our method, the first large-scale benchmark dataset for this field named Thermal Infrared Novel-view Synthesis Dataset (TI-NSD) is created. This dataset comprises 20 authentic thermal infrared video scenes, covering indoor, outdoor, and UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) scenarios, totaling 6,664 frames of thermal infrared image data. Based on this dataset, this paper experimentally verifies the effectiveness of Thermal3D-GS. The results indicate that our method outperforms the baseline method with a 3.03 dB improvement in PSNR and significantly addresses the issues of floaters and indistinct edge features present in the baseline method. Our dataset and codebase will be released in \\href{https://github.com/mzzcdf/Thermal3DGS}{\\textcolor{red}{Thermal3DGS}}.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08042](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08042) |
| 495 | GS-ROR: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Reflective Object Relighting via SDF Priors | Zuo-Liang Zhu,Beibei Wang,Jian Yang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown a powerful capability for novel view synthesis due to its detailed expressive ability and highly efficient rendering speed. Unfortunately, creating relightable 3D assets with 3DGS is still problematic, particularly for reflective objects, as its discontinuous representation raises difficulties in constraining geometries. Inspired by previous works, the signed distance field (SDF) can serve as an effective way for geometry regularization. However, a direct incorporation between Gaussians and SDF significantly slows training. To this end, we propose GS-ROR for reflective objects relighting with 3DGS aided by SDF priors. At the core of our method is the mutual supervision of the depth and normal between deferred Gaussians and SDF, which avoids the expensive volume rendering of SDF. Thanks to this mutual supervision, the learned deferred Gaussians are well-constrained with a minimal time cost. As the Gaussians are rendered in a deferred shading mode, while the alpha-blended Gaussians are smooth, individual Gaussians may still be outliers, yielding floater artifacts. Therefore, we further introduce an SDF-aware pruning strategy to remove Gaussian outliers, which are located distant from the surface defined by SDF, avoiding the floater issue. Consequently, our method outperforms the existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods in terms of relighting quality. Our method also exhibits competitive relighting quality compared to NeRF-based methods with at most 25% of training time and allows rendering at 200+ frames per second on an RTX4090.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18544](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18544) |
| 494 | SwinGS: Sliding Window Gaussian Splatting for Volumetric Video Streaming with Arbitrary Length | Bangya Liu,Suman Banerjee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have garnered significant attention in computer vision and computer graphics due to its high rendering speed and remarkable quality. While extant research has endeavored to extend the application of 3DGS from static to dynamic scenes, such efforts have been consistently impeded by excessive model sizes, constraints on video duration, and content deviation. These limitations significantly compromise the streamability of dynamic 3D Gaussian models, thereby restricting their utility in downstream applications, including volumetric video, autonomous vehicle, and immersive technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality.  This paper introduces SwinGS, a novel framework for training, delivering, and rendering volumetric video in a real-time streaming fashion. To address the aforementioned challenges and enhance streamability, SwinGS integrates spacetime Gaussian with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to adapt the model to fit various 3D scenes across frames, in the meantime employing a sliding window captures Gaussian snapshots for each frame in an accumulative way. We implement a prototype of SwinGS and demonstrate its streamability across various datasets and scenes. Additionally, we develop an interactive WebGL viewer enabling real-time volumetric video playback on most devices with modern browsers, including smartphones and tablets. Experimental results show that SwinGS reduces transmission costs by 83.6% compared to previous work with ignorable compromise in PSNR. Moreover, SwinGS easily scales to long video sequences without compromising quality.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07759](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07759) |

This latter dynamically exploits depth cues from a readily available stereo network, processing virtual stereo pairs rendered by the GS model itself during training and achieving consistent self-improvement of the scene representation.

In this work, we present High-resolution Image-to-3D model (Hi3D), a new video diffusion based paradigm that redefines a single image to multi-view images as 3D-aware sequential image generation (i.e., orbital video generation). This methodology delves into the underlying temporal consistency knowledge in video diffusion model that generalizes well to geometry consistency across multiple views in 3D generation. Technically, Hi3D first empowers the pre-trained video diffusion model with 3D-aware prior (camera pose condition), yielding multi-view images with low-resolution texture details. A 3D-aware video-to-video refiner is learnt to further scale up the multi-view images with high-resolution texture details. Such high-resolution multi-view images are further augmented with novel views through 3D Gaussian Splatting, which are finally leveraged to obtain high-fidelity meshes via 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both novel view synthesis and single view reconstruction demonstrate that our Hi3D manages to produce superior multi-view consistency images with highly-detailed textures.

Leveraging foundation models as priors, our approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods and boosts the performance to ensure the high-fidelity generation required by the display devices. The proposed system consists of two main steps: depth-based video splatting for warping and extracting occlusion mask, and stereo video inpainting. We utilize pre-trained stable video diffusion as the backbone and introduce a fine-tuning protocol for the stereo video inpainting task. To handle input video with varying lengths and resolutions, we explore auto-regressive strategies and tiled processing. Finally, a sophisticated data processing pipeline has been developed to reconstruct a large-scale and high-quality dataset to support our training. Our framework demonstrates significant improvements in 2D-to-3D video conversion, offering a practical solution for creating immersive content for 3D devices like Apple Vision Pro and 3D displays.

GSNs take a single observation as input to generate a Gaussian splat representation describing the observed object's geometry and texture. By using a shared feature extractor before decoding Gaussian colors, covariances, positions, and opacities, GSNs achieve extremely high throughput (>150FPS). Experiments demonstrate that GSNs can be trained efficiently using a multi-view rendering loss and are competitive, in quality, with expensive diffusion-based reconstruction algorithms. The GSN model is validated on multiple benchmark experiments. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential for GSNs to be used within a robotic manipulation pipeline for object-centric grasping.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07245](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07245) |
| 489 | ThermalGaussian: Thermal 3D Gaussian Splatting | Rongfeng Lu,Hangyu Chen,Zunjie Zhu,Yuhang Qin,Ming Lu,Le Zhang,Chenggang Yan,Anke Xue | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Thermography is especially valuable for the military and other users of surveillance cameras. Some recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are proposed to reconstruct the thermal scenes in 3D from a set of thermal and RGB images. However, unlike NeRF, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) prevails due to its rapid training and real-time rendering. In this work, we propose ThermalGaussian, the first thermal 3DGS approach capable of rendering high-quality images in RGB and thermal modalities. We first calibrate the RGB camera and the thermal camera to ensure that both modalities are accurately aligned. Subsequently, we use the registered images to learn the multimodal 3D Gaussians. To prevent the overfitting of any single modality, we introduce several multimodal regularization constraints. We also develop smoothing constraints tailored to the physical characteristics of the thermal modality. Besides, we contribute a real-world dataset named RGBT-Scenes, captured by a hand-hold thermal-infrared camera, facilitating future research on thermal scene reconstruction. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that ThermalGaussian achieves photorealistic rendering of thermal images and improves the rendering quality of RGB images. With the proposed multimodal regularization constraints, we also reduced the model's storage cost by 90\\%.

| 488 | Gaussian Opacity Fields: Efficient Adaptive Surface Reconstruction in Unbounded Scenes | Zehao Yu,Torsten Sattler,Andreas Geiger | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis results, while allowing the rendering of high-resolution images in real-time. However, leveraging 3D Gaussians for surface reconstruction poses significant challenges due to the explicit and disconnected nature of 3D Gaussians. In this work, we present Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF), a novel approach for efficient, high-quality, and adaptive surface reconstruction in unbounded scenes. Our GOF is derived from ray-tracing-based volume rendering of 3D Gaussians, enabling direct geometry extraction from 3D Gaussians by identifying its levelset, without resorting to Poisson reconstruction or TSDF fusion as in previous work. We approximate the surface normal of Gaussians as the normal of the ray-Gaussian intersection plane, enabling the application of regularization that significantly enhances geometry. Furthermore, we develop an efficient geometry extraction method utilizing Marching Tetrahedra, where the tetrahedral grids are induced from 3D Gaussians and thus adapt to the scene's complexity. Our evaluations reveal that GOF surpasses existing 3DGS-based methods in surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Further, it compares favorably to or even outperforms, neural implicit methods in both quality and speed.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10772](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10772) |

However, adapting 3DGS to different camera models, particularly fisheye lenses, poses challenges due to the unique 3D to 2D projection calculation. Additionally, there are inefficiencies in the tile-based splatting, especially for the extreme curvature and wide field of view of fisheye lenses, which are crucial for its broader real-life applications. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Fisheye-GS.This innovative method recalculates the projection transformation and its gradients for fisheye cameras. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated as a module into other efficient 3D rendering methods, emphasizing its extensibility, lightweight nature, and modular design. Since we only modified the projection component, it can also be easily adapted for use with different camera models.

| 486 | Dynamic Gaussian Marbles for Novel View Synthesis of Casual Monocular Videos | Colton Stearns,Adam Harley,Mikaela Uy,Florian Dubost,Federico Tombari,Gordon Wetzstein,Leonidas Guibas | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian splatting has become a popular representation for novel-view synthesis, exhibiting clear strengths in efficiency, photometric quality, and compositional edibility. Following its success, many works have extended Gaussians to 4D, showing that dynamic Gaussians maintain these benefits while also tracking scene geometry far better than alternative representations. Yet, these methods assume dense multi-view videos as supervision. In this work, we are interested in extending the capability of Gaussian scene representations to casually captured monocular videos. We show that existing 4D Gaussian methods dramatically fail in this setup because the monocular setting is underconstrained. Building off this finding, we propose a method we call Dynamic Gaussian Marbles, which consist of three core modifications that target the difficulties of the monocular setting. First, we use isotropic Gaussian "marbles'', reducing the degrees of freedom of each Gaussian. Second, we employ a hierarchical divide and-conquer learning strategy to efficiently guide the optimization towards solutions with globally coherent motion. Finally, we add image-level and geometry-level priors into the optimization, including a tracking loss that takes advantage of recent progress in point tracking. By constraining the optimization, Dynamic Gaussian Marbles learns Gaussian trajectories that enable novel-view rendering and accurately capture the 3D motion of the scene elements. We evaluate on the Nvidia Dynamic Scenes dataset and the DyCheck iPhone dataset, and show that Gaussian Marbles significantly outperforms other Gaussian baselines in quality, and is on-par with non-Gaussian representations, all while maintaining the efficiency, compositionality, editability, and tracking benefits of Gaussians.

As an alternative, we can modify the physics grounded Newtonian dynamics to align with 3D Gaussian components. Current models take the first-order approximation of a deformation map, which locally approximates the dynamics by linear transformations. In contrast, our Gaussian Splatting for Physics-Based Simulations (GASP) model uses such a map (without any modifications) and flat Gaussian distributions, which are parameterized by three points (mesh faces). Subsequently, each 3D point (mesh face node) is treated as a discrete entity within a 3D space. Consequently, the problem of modeling Gaussian components is reduced to working with 3D points. Additionally, the information on mesh faces can be used to incorporate further properties into the physics model, facilitating the use of triangles. Resulting solution can be integrated into any physics engine that can be treated as a black box. As demonstrated in our studies, the proposed model exhibits superior performance on a diverse range of benchmark datasets designed for 3D object rendering.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05819](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05819) |
| 477 | LiDAR-3DGS: LiDAR Reinforced 3D Gaussian Splatting for Multimodal Radiance Field Rendering | Hansol Lim,Hanbeom Chang,Jongseong Brad Choi,Chul Min Yeum | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we explore the capabilities of multimodal inputs to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based Radiance Field Rendering. We present LiDAR-3DGS, a novel method of reinforcing 3DGS inputs with LiDAR generated point clouds to significantly improve the accuracy and detail of 3D models. We demonstrate a systematic approach of LiDAR reinforcement to 3DGS to enable capturing of important features such as bolts, apertures, and other details that are often missed by image-based features alone. These details are crucial for engineering applications such as remote monitoring and maintenance. Without modifying the underlying 3DGS algorithm, we demonstrate that even a modest addition of LiDAR generated point cloud significantly enhances the perceptual quality of the models. At 30k iterations, the model generated by our method resulted in an increase of 7.064% in PSNR and 0.565% in SSIM, respectively. Since the LiDAR used in this research was a commonly used commercial-grade device, the improvements observed were modest and can be further enhanced with higher-grade LiDAR systems. Additionally, these improvements can be supplementary to other derivative works of Radiance Field Rendering and also provide a new insight for future LiDAR and computer vision integrated modeling.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16296](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16296) |

We achieve this by incorporating a point-based representation into the high-resolution layers of the hierarchical hash tables of an InstantNGP representation. As our points are equipped with a field of influence, our representation can be interpreted as a mixture of Gaussians stored within the hash table. We propose a loss that encourages the movement of our Gaussians towards regions that require more representation budget to be sufficiently well represented. Our main finding is that our representation allows the reconstruction of signals using a more compact representation without compromising quality.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05334](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05334) |
| 475 | TOGS: Gaussian Splatting with Temporal Opacity Offset for Real-Time 4D DSA Rendering | Shuai Zhang,Huangxuan Zhao,Zhenghong Zhou,Guanjun Wu,Chuansheng Zheng,Xinggang Wang,Wenyu Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Four-dimensional Digital Subtraction Angiography (4D DSA) is a medical imaging technique that provides a series of 2D images captured at different stages and angles during the process of contrast agent filling blood vessels. It plays a significant role in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases. Improving the rendering quality and speed under sparse sampling is important for observing the status and location of lesions. The current methods exhibit inadequate rendering quality in sparse views and suffer from slow rendering speed. To overcome these limitations, we propose TOGS, a Gaussian splatting method with opacity offset over time, which can effectively improve the rendering quality and speed of 4D DSA. We introduce an opacity offset table for each Gaussian to model the opacity offsets of the Gaussian, using these opacity-varying Gaussians to model the temporal variations in the radiance of the contrast agent. By interpolating the opacity offset table, the opacity variation of the Gaussian at different time points can be determined. This enables us to render the 2D DSA image at that specific moment. Additionally, we introduced a Smooth loss term in the loss function to mitigate overfitting issues that may arise in the model when dealing with sparse view scenarios. During the training phase, we randomly prune Gaussians, thereby reducing the storage overhead of the model. The experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods, this model achieves state-of-the-art render quality under the same number of training views. Additionally, it enables real-time rendering while maintaining low storage overhead.

However, current approaches face challenges such as limited data diversity and inadequate augmentation for effective feature learning. To address these challenges, we propose GS-PT, which integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into point cloud self-supervised learning for the first time. Our pipeline utilizes transformers as the backbone for self-supervised pre-training and introduces novel contrastive learning tasks through 3DGS. Specifically, the transformers aim to reconstruct the masked point cloud. 3DGS utilizes multi-view rendered images as input to generate enhanced point cloud distributions and novel view images, facilitating data augmentation and cross-modal contrastive learning. Additionally, we incorporate features from depth maps. By optimizing these tasks collectively, our method enriches the tri-modal self-supervised learning process, enabling the model to leverage the correlation across 3D point clouds and 2D images from various modalities. We freeze the encoder after pre-training and test the model's performance on multiple downstream tasks. Experimental results indicate that GS-PT outperforms the off-the-shelf self-supervised learning methods on various downstream tasks including 3D object classification, real-world classifications, and few-shot learning and segmentation.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04963](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04963) |
| 473 | GST: Precise 3D Human Body from a Single Image with Gaussian Splatting Transformers | Lorenza Prospero,Abdullah Hamdi,Joao F. Henriques,Christian Rupprecht | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing realistic 3D human models from monocular images has significant applications in creative industries, human-computer interfaces, and healthcare. We base our work on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a scene representation composed of a mixture of Gaussians. Predicting such mixtures for a human from a single input image is challenging, as it is a non-uniform density (with a many-to-one relationship with input pixels) with strict physical constraints. At the same time, it needs to be flexible to accommodate a variety of clothes and poses. Our key observation is that the vertices of standardized human meshes (such as SMPL) can provide an adequate density and approximate initial position for Gaussians. We can then train a transformer model to jointly predict comparatively small adjustments to these positions, as well as the other Gaussians' attributes and the SMPL parameters. We show empirically that this combination (using only multi-view supervision) can achieve fast inference of 3D human models from a single image without test-time optimization, expensive diffusion models, or 3D points supervision. We also show that it can improve 3D pose estimation by better fitting human models that account for clothes and other variations.

| 472 | Gaussian Splatting in Style | Abhishek Saroha,Mariia Gladkova,Cecilia Curreli,Dominik Muhle,Tarun Yenamandra,Daniel Cremers | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D scene stylization extends the work of neural style transfer to 3D. A vital challenge in this problem is to maintain the uniformity of the stylized appearance across multiple views. A vast majority of the previous works achieve this by training a 3D model for every stylized image and a set of multi-view images. In contrast, we propose a novel architecture trained on a collection of style images that, at test time, produces real time high-quality stylized novel views. We choose the underlying 3D scene representation for our model as 3D Gaussian splatting. We take the 3D Gaussians and process them using a multi-resolution hash grid and a tiny MLP to obtain stylized views. The MLP is conditioned on different style codes for generalization to different styles during test time. The explicit nature of 3D Gaussians gives us inherent advantages over NeRF-based methods, including geometric consistency and a fast training and rendering regime. This enables our method to be useful for various practical use cases, such as augmented or virtual reality. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior visual quality on various indoor and outdoor real-world data.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08498](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08498) |

To effectively model correlations between views, existing methods typically predict disparity between two views on a 2D plane, which works well for small disparities, such as in stereo images, but struggles with larger disparities caused by significant view changes. To address this, we propose a novel approach: learning-based multi-view image coding with 3D Gaussian geometric priors (3D-GP-LMVIC). Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to derive geometric priors of the 3D scene, enabling more accurate disparity estimation across views within the compression model. Additionally, we introduce a depth map compression model to reduce redundancy in geometric information between views. A multi-view sequence ordering method is also proposed to enhance correlations between adjacent views. Experimental results demonstrate that 3D-GP-LMVIC surpasses both traditional and learning-based methods in performance, while maintaining fast encoding and decoding speed.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04013](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04013) |

Although these techniques can recover relatively clear 3D reconstructions from blurry image inputs, they still face limitations in handling severe blurring and complex camera motion. To address these issues, we propose Event-assisted 3D Deblur Reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting (EaDeblur-GS), which integrates event camera data to enhance the robustness of 3DGS against motion blur. By employing an Adaptive Deviation Estimator (ADE) network to estimate Gaussian center deviations and using novel loss functions, EaDeblur-GS achieves sharp 3D reconstructions in real-time, demonstrating performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13520](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13520) |
| 469 | G-Style: Stylized Gaussian Splatting | \xc3\x81ron Samuel Kov\xc3\xa1cs,Pedro Hermosilla,Renata G. Raidou | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce G-Style, a novel algorithm designed to transfer the style of an image onto a 3D scene represented using Gaussian Splatting. Gaussian Splatting is a powerful 3D representation for novel view synthesis, as -- compared to other approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields -- it provides fast scene renderings and user control over the scene. Recent pre-prints have demonstrated that the style of Gaussian Splatting scenes can be modified using an image exemplar. However, since the scene geometry remains fixed during the stylization process, current solutions fall short of producing satisfactory results. Our algorithm aims to address these limitations by following a three-step process: In a pre-processing step, we remove undesirable Gaussians with large projection areas or highly elongated shapes. Subsequently, we combine several losses carefully designed to preserve different scales of the style in the image, while maintaining as much as possible the integrity of the original scene content. During the stylization process and following the original design of Gaussian Splatting, we split Gaussians where additional detail is necessary within our scene by tracking the gradient of the stylized color. Our experiments demonstrate that G-Style generates high-quality stylizations within just a few minutes, outperforming existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15695](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15695) |
| 468 | Optimizing 3D Gaussian Splatting for Sparse Viewpoint Scene Reconstruction | Shen Chen,Jiale Zhou,Lei Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising approach for 3D scene representation, offering a reduction in computational overhead compared to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, 3DGS is susceptible to high-frequency artifacts and demonstrates suboptimal performance under sparse viewpoint conditions, thereby limiting its applicability in robotics and computer vision. To address these limitations, we introduce SVS-GS, a novel framework for Sparse Viewpoint Scene reconstruction that integrates a 3D Gaussian smoothing filter to suppress artifacts. Furthermore, our approach incorporates a Depth Gradient Profile Prior (DGPP) loss with a dynamic depth mask to sharpen edges and 2D diffusion with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss to enhance geometric consistency in novel view synthesis. Experimental evaluations on the MipNeRF-360 and SeaThru-NeRF datasets demonstrate that SVS-GS markedly improves 3D reconstruction from sparse viewpoints, offering a robust and efficient solution for scene understanding in robotics and computer vision applications.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03213](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03213) |
| 467 | Human-VDM: Learning Single-Image 3D Human Gaussian Splatting from Video Diffusion Models | Zhibin Liu,Haoye Dong,Aviral Chharia,Hefeng Wu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Generating lifelike 3D humans from a single RGB image remains a challenging task in computer vision, as it requires accurate modeling of geometry, high-quality texture, and plausible unseen parts. Existing methods typically use multi-view diffusion models for 3D generation, but they often face inconsistent view issues, which hinder high-quality 3D human generation. To address this, we propose Human-VDM, a novel method for generating 3D human from a single RGB image using Video Diffusion Models. Human-VDM provides temporally consistent views for 3D human generation using Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three modules: a view-consistent human video diffusion module, a video augmentation module, and a Gaussian Splatting module. First, a single image is fed into a human video diffusion module to generate a coherent human video. Next, the video augmentation module applies super-resolution and video interpolation to enhance the textures and geometric smoothness of the generated video. Finally, the 3D Human Gaussian Splatting module learns lifelike humans under the guidance of these high-resolution and view-consistent images. Experiments demonstrate that Human-VDM achieves high-quality 3D human from a single image, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both generation quality and quantity.

| 466 | Object Gaussian for Monocular 6D Pose Estimation from Sparse Views | Luqing Luo,Shichu Sun,Jiangang Yang,Linfang Zheng,Jinwei Du,Jian Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Monocular object pose estimation, as a pivotal task in computer vision and robotics, heavily depends on accurate 2D-3D correspondences, which often demand costly CAD models that may not be readily available. Object 3D reconstruction methods offer an alternative, among which recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) afford a compelling potential. Yet its performance still suffers and tends to overfit with fewer input views. Embracing this challenge, we introduce SGPose, a novel framework for sparse view object pose estimation using Gaussian-based methods. Given as few as ten views, SGPose generates a geometric-aware representation by starting with a random cuboid initialization, eschewing reliance on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline-derived geometry as required by traditional 3DGS methods. SGPose removes the dependence on CAD models by regressing dense 2D-3D correspondences between images and the reconstructed model from sparse input and random initialization, while the geometric-consistent depth supervision and online synthetic view warping are key to the success. Experiments on typical benchmarks, especially on the Occlusion LM-O dataset, demonstrate that SGPose outperforms existing methods even under sparse view constraints, under-scoring its potential in real-world applications.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02581](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02581) |
| 465 | Volumetric Surfaces: Representing Fuzzy Geometries with Multiple Meshes | Stefano Esposito,Anpei Chen,Christian Reiser,Samuel Rota Bul\xc3\xb2,Lorenzo Porzi,Katja Schwarz,Christian Richardt,Michael Zollh\xc3\xb6fer,Peter Kontschieder,Andreas Geiger | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>High-quality real-time view synthesis methods are based on volume rendering, splatting, or surface rendering. While surface-based methods generally are the fastest, they cannot faithfully model fuzzy geometry like hair. In turn, alpha-blending techniques excel at representing fuzzy materials but require an unbounded number of samples per ray (P1). Further overheads are induced by empty space skipping in volume rendering (P2) and sorting input primitives in splatting (P3). These problems are exacerbated on low-performance graphics hardware, e.g. on mobile devices. We present a novel representation for real-time view synthesis where the (P1) number of sampling locations is small and bounded, (P2) sampling locations are efficiently found via rasterization, and (P3) rendering is sorting-free. We achieve this by representing objects as semi-transparent multi-layer meshes, rendered in fixed layer order from outermost to innermost. We model mesh layers as SDF shells with optimal spacing learned during training. After baking, we fit UV textures to the corresponding meshes. We show that our method can represent challenging fuzzy objects while achieving higher frame rates than volume-based and splatting-based methods on low-end and mobile devices.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02482](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02482) |

Previous generalizable 3D gaussian splatting methods are limited to rendering novel views that are very close to the original pair of images, which cannot handle large differences in viewpoint. Especially in autonomous driving scenarios, images are typically collected from a single lane. The limited training perspective makes rendering images of a different lane very challenging. To further improve the rendering capability of GGS under large viewpoint changes, we introduces a novel virtual lane generation module into GSS method to enables high-quality lane switching even without a multi-lane dataset. Besides, we design a diffusion loss to supervise the generation of virtual lane image to further address the problem of lack of data in the virtual lanes. Finally, we also propose a depth refinement module to optimize depth estimation in the GSS model. Extensive validation of our method, compared to existing approaches, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02382](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02382) |

Tracking points allow for geometric reconstruction [14], while geometric reconstruction of (dynamic) scenes allows for 3D tracking of points over time [24, 39]. The latter was recently also exploited for 2D point tracking to overcome occlusion ambiguities by lifting tracking directly into 3D [38]. However, above approaches either require offline processing or multi-view camera setups both unrealistic for real-world applications like robot navigation or mixed reality. We target the challenge of online 2D and 3D point tracking from unposed monocular camera input introducing Dynamic Online Monocular Reconstruction (DynOMo). We leverage 3D Gaussian splatting to reconstruct dynamic scenes in an online fashion. Our approach extends 3D Gaussians to capture new content and object motions while estimating camera movements from a single RGB frame. DynOMo stands out by enabling emergence of point trajectories through robust image feature reconstruction and a novel similarity-enhanced regularization term, without requiring any correspondence-level supervision. It sets the first baseline for online point tracking with monocular unposed cameras, achieving performance on par with existing methods. We aim to inspire the community to advance online point tracking and reconstruction, expanding the applicability to diverse real-world scenarios.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02104](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02104) |
| 462 | GraspSplats: Efficient Manipulation with 3D Feature Splatting | Mazeyu Ji,Ri-Zhao Qiu,Xueyan Zou,Xiaolong Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The ability for robots to perform efficient and zero-shot grasping of object parts is crucial for practical applications and is becoming prevalent with recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To bridge the 2D-to-3D gap for representations to support such a capability, existing methods rely on neural fields (NeRFs) via differentiable rendering or point-based projection methods. However, we demonstrate that NeRFs are inappropriate for scene changes due to their implicitness and point-based methods are inaccurate for part localization without rendering-based optimization. To amend these issues, we propose GraspSplats. Using depth supervision and a novel reference feature computation method, GraspSplats generates high-quality scene representations in under 60 seconds. We further validate the advantages of Gaussian-based representation by showing that the explicit and optimized geometry in GraspSplats is sufficient to natively support (1) real-time grasp sampling and (2) dynamic and articulated object manipulation with point trackers. With extensive experiments on a Franka robot, we demonstrate that GraspSplats significantly outperforms existing methods under diverse task settings. In particular, GraspSplats outperforms NeRF-based methods like F3RM and LERF-TOGO, and 2D detection methods.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02084](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02084) |

| 460 | PRoGS: Progressive Rendering of Gaussian Splats | Brent Zoomers,Maarten Wijnants,Ivan Molenaers,Joni Vanherck,Jeroen Put,Lode Jorissen,Nick Michiels | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Over the past year, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has received significant attention for its ability to represent 3D scenes in a perceptually accurate manner. However, it can require a substantial amount of storage since each splat's individual data must be stored. While compression techniques offer a potential solution by reducing the memory footprint, they still necessitate retrieving the entire scene before any part of it can be rendered. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for progressively rendering such scenes, aiming to display visible content that closely approximates the final scene as early as possible without loading the entire scene into memory. This approach benefits both on-device rendering applications limited by memory constraints and streaming applications where minimal bandwidth usage is preferred. To achieve this, we approximate the contribution of each Gaussian to the final scene and construct an order of prioritization on their inclusion in the rendering process. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be combined with existing compression methods to progressively render (and stream) 3DGS scenes, optimizing bandwidth usage by focusing on the most important splats within a scene. Overall, our work establishes a foundation for making remotely hosted 3DGS content more quickly accessible to end-users in over-the-top consumption scenarios, with our results showing significant improvements in quality across all metrics compared to existing methods.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01761](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01761) |

However, existing learning-based point cloud upsampling methods are constrained by computational resources and batch processing strategies, which often require subdividing point clouds into smaller patches, leading to distortions that degrade perceptual quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel 2D-3D hybrid colored point cloud upsampling framework (GaussianPU) based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for robotic perception. This approach leverages 3DGS to bridge 3D point clouds with their 2D rendered images in robot vision systems. A dual scale rendered image restoration network transforms sparse point cloud renderings into dense representations, which are then input into 3DGS along with precise robot camera poses and interpolated sparse point clouds to reconstruct dense 3D point clouds. We have made a series of enhancements to the vanilla 3DGS, enabling precise control over the number of points and significantly boosting the quality of the upsampled point cloud for robotic scene understanding. Our framework supports processing entire point clouds on a single consumer-grade GPU, such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, eliminating the need for segmentation and thus producing high-quality, dense colored point clouds with millions of points for robot navigation and manipulation tasks. Extensive experimental results on generating million-level point cloud data validate the effectiveness of our method, substantially improving the quality of colored point clouds and demonstrating significant potential for applications involving large-scale point clouds in autonomous robotics and human-robot interaction scenarios.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01581](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01581) |

| 456 | RT-GS2: Real-Time Generalizable Semantic Segmentation for 3D Gaussian Representations of Radiance Fields | Mihnea-Bogdan Jurca,Remco Royen,Ion Giosan,Adrian Munteanu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized the world of novel view synthesis by achieving high rendering performance in real-time. Recently, studies have focused on enriching these 3D representations with semantic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce RT-GS2, the first generalizable semantic segmentation method employing Gaussian Splatting. While existing Gaussian Splatting-based approaches rely on scene-specific training, RT-GS2 demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen scenes. Our method adopts a new approach by first extracting view-independent 3D Gaussian features in a self-supervised manner, followed by a novel View-Dependent / View-Independent (VDVI) feature fusion to enhance semantic consistency over different views. Extensive experimentation on three different datasets showcases RT-GS2's superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation quality, exemplified by a 8.01% increase in mIoU on the Replica dataset. Moreover, our method achieves real-time performance of 27.03 FPS, marking an astonishing 901 times speedup compared to existing approaches.

Duisterhof,Zhao Mandi,Yunchao Yao,Jia-Wei Liu,Jenny Seidenschwarz,Mike Zheng Shou,Deva Ramanan,Shuran Song,Stan Birchfield,Bowen Wen,Jeffrey Ichnowski | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Teaching robots to fold, drape, or reposition deformable objects such as cloth will unlock a variety of automation applications. While remarkable progress has been made for rigid object manipulation, manipulating deformable objects poses unique challenges, including frequent occlusions, infinite-dimensional state spaces and complex dynamics. Just as object pose estimation and tracking have aided robots for rigid manipulation, dense 3D tracking (scene flow) of highly deformable objects will enable new applications in robotics while aiding existing approaches, such as imitation learning or creating digital twins with real2sim transfer. We propose DeformGS, an approach to recover scene flow in highly deformable scenes, using simultaneous video captures of a dynamic scene from multiple cameras. DeformGS builds on recent advances in Gaussian splatting, a method that learns the properties of a large number of Gaussians for state-of-the-art and fast novel-view synthesis. DeformGS learns a deformation function to project a set of Gaussians with canonical properties into world space. The deformation function uses a neural-voxel encoding and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to infer Gaussian position, rotation, and a shadow scalar. We enforce physics-inspired regularization terms based on conservation of momentum and isometry, which leads to trajectories with smaller trajectory errors. We also leverage existing foundation models SAM and XMEM to produce noisy masks, and learn a per-Gaussian mask for better physics-inspired regularization. DeformGS achieves high-quality 3D tracking on highly deformable scenes with shadows and occlusions. In experiments, DeformGS improves 3D tracking by an average of 55.8% compared to the state-of-the-art. With sufficient texture, DeformGS achieves a median tracking error of 3.3 mm on a cloth of 1.5 x 1.5 m in area.

| 454 | OG-Mapping: Octree-based Structured 3D Gaussians for Online Dense Mapping | Meng Wang,Junyi Wang,Changqun Xia,Chen Wang,Yue Qi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated promising advancements in RGB-D online dense mapping. Nevertheless, existing methods excessively rely on per-pixel depth cues to perform map densification, which leads to significant redundancy and increased sensitivity to depth noise. Additionally, explicitly storing 3D Gaussian parameters of room-scale scene poses a significant storage challenge. In this paper, we introduce OG-Mapping, which leverages the robust scene structural representation capability of sparse octrees, combined with structured 3D Gaussian representations, to achieve efficient and robust online dense mapping. Moreover, OG-Mapping employs an anchor-based progressive map refinement strategy to recover the scene structures at multiple levels of detail. Instead of maintaining a small number of active keyframes with a fixed keyframe window as previous approaches do, a dynamic keyframe window is employed to allow OG-Mapping to better tackle false local minima and forgetting issues. Experimental results demonstrate that OG-Mapping delivers more robust and superior realism mapping results than existing Gaussian-based RGB-D online mapping methods with a compact model, and no additional post-processing is required.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17223](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17223) |
| 453 | 2DGH: 2D Gaussian-Hermite Splatting for High-quality Rendering and Better Geometry Reconstruction | Ruihan Yu,Tianyu Huang,Jingwang Ling,Feng Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>2D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as a significant method in 3D reconstruction, enabling novel view synthesis and geometry reconstruction simultaneously. While the well-known Gaussian kernel is broadly used, its lack of anisotropy and deformation ability leads to dim and vague edges at object silhouettes, limiting the reconstruction quality of current Gaussian splatting methods. To enhance the representation power, we draw inspiration from quantum physics and propose to use the Gaussian-Hermite kernel as the new primitive in Gaussian splatting. The new kernel takes a unified mathematical form and extends the Gaussian function, which serves as the zero-rank term in the updated formulation. Our experiments demonstrate the extraordinary performance of Gaussian-Hermite kernel in both geometry reconstruction and novel-view synthesis tasks. The proposed kernel outperforms traditional Gaussian Splatting kernels, showcasing its potential for high-quality 3D reconstruction and rendering.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16982](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16982) |
| 452 | ReconX: Reconstruct Any Scene from Sparse Views with Video Diffusion Model | Fangfu Liu,Wenqiang Sun,Hanyang Wang,Yikai Wang,Haowen Sun,Junliang Ye,Jun Zhang,Yueqi Duan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Advancements in 3D scene reconstruction have transformed 2D images from the real world into 3D models, producing realistic 3D results from hundreds of input photos. Despite great success in dense-view reconstruction scenarios, rendering a detailed scene from insufficient captured views is still an ill-posed optimization problem, often resulting in artifacts and distortions in unseen areas. In this paper, we propose ReconX, a novel 3D scene reconstruction paradigm that reframes the ambiguous reconstruction challenge as a temporal generation task. The key insight is to unleash the strong generative prior of large pre-trained video diffusion models for sparse-view reconstruction. However, 3D view consistency struggles to be accurately preserved in directly generated video frames from pre-trained models. To address this, given limited input views, the proposed ReconX first constructs a global point cloud and encodes it into a contextual space as the 3D structure condition. Guided by the condition, the video diffusion model then synthesizes video frames that are both detail-preserved and exhibit a high degree of 3D consistency, ensuring the coherence of the scene from various perspectives. Finally, we recover the 3D scene from the generated video through a confidence-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets show the superiority of our ReconX over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and generalizability.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16767](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16767) |

Recent methods for modeling driving sequences using neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated the potential of reconstructing challenging dynamic scenes, but often overlook pedestrians and other non-vehicle dynamic actors, hindering a complete pipeline for dynamic urban scene reconstruction. To that end, we propose a comprehensive 3DGS framework for driving scenes, named OmniRe, that allows for accurate, full-length reconstruction of diverse dynamic objects in a driving log. OmniRe builds dynamic neural scene graphs based on Gaussian representations and constructs multiple local canonical spaces that model various dynamic actors, including vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists, among many others. This capability is unmatched by existing methods. OmniRe allows us to holistically reconstruct different objects present in the scene, subsequently enabling the simulation of reconstructed scenarios with all actors participating in real-time (~60Hz). Extensive evaluations on the Waymo dataset show that our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively by a large margin. We believe our work fills a critical gap in driving reconstruction.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16760](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16760) |
| 450 | Re-Nerfing: Improving Novel View Synthesis through Novel View Synthesis | Felix Tristram,Stefano Gasperini,Nassir Navab,Federico Tombari | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent neural rendering and reconstruction techniques, such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splatting, have shown remarkable novel view synthesis capabilities but require hundreds of images of the scene from diverse viewpoints to render high-quality novel views. With fewer images available, these methods start to fail since they can no longer correctly triangulate the underlying 3D geometry and converge to a non-optimal solution. These failures can manifest as floaters or blurry renderings in sparsely observed areas of the scene. In this paper, we propose Re-Nerfing, a simple and general add-on approach that leverages novel view synthesis itself to tackle this problem. Using an already trained NVS method, we render novel views between existing ones and augment the training data to optimize a second model. This introduces additional multi-view constraints and allows the second model to converge to a better solution. With Re-Nerfing we achieve significant improvements upon multiple pipelines based on NeRF and Gaussian-Splatting in sparse view settings of the mip-NeRF 360 and LLFF datasets. Notably, Re-Nerfing does not require prior knowledge or extra supervision signals, making it a flexible and practical add-on.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02255](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02255) |
| 449 | Towards Realistic Example-based Modeling via 3D Gaussian Stitching | Xinyu Gao,Ziyi Yang,Bingchen Gong,Xiaoguang Han,Sipeng Yang,Xiaogang Jin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Using parts of existing models to rebuild new models, commonly termed as example-based modeling, is a classical methodology in the realm of computer graphics. Previous works mostly focus on shape composition, making them very hard to use for realistic composition of 3D objects captured from real-world scenes. This leads to combining multiple NeRFs into a single 3D scene to achieve seamless appearance blending. However, the current SeamlessNeRF method struggles to achieve interactive editing and harmonious stitching for real-world scenes due to its gradient-based strategy and grid-based representation. To this end, we present an example-based modeling method that combines multiple Gaussian fields in a point-based representation using sample-guided synthesis. Specifically, as for composition, we create a GUI to segment and transform multiple fields in real time, easily obtaining a semantically meaningful composition of models represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). For texture blending, due to the discrete and irregular nature of 3DGS, straightforwardly applying gradient propagation as SeamlssNeRF is not supported. Thus, a novel sampling-based cloning method is proposed to harmonize the blending while preserving the original rich texture and content. Our workflow consists of three steps: 1) real-time segmentation and transformation of a Gaussian model using a well-tailored GUI, 2) KNN analysis to identify boundary points in the intersecting area between the source and target models, and 3) two-phase optimization of the target model using sampling-based cloning and gradient constraints. Extensive experimental results validate that our approach significantly outperforms previous works in terms of realistic synthesis, demonstrating its practicality.

| 448 | OMEGAS: Object Mesh Extraction from Large Scenes Guided by Gaussian Segmentation | Lizhi Wang,Feng Zhou,Bo yu,Pu Cao,Jianqin Yin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction technologies have paved the way for high-quality and real-time rendering of complex 3D scenes. Despite these achievements, a notable challenge persists: it is difficult to precisely reconstruct specific objects from large scenes. Current scene reconstruction techniques frequently result in the loss of object detail textures and are unable to reconstruct object portions that are occluded or unseen in views. To address this challenge, we delve into the meticulous 3D reconstruction of specific objects within large scenes and propose a framework termed OMEGAS: Object Mesh Extraction from Large Scenes Guided by Gaussian Segmentation. Specifically, we proposed a novel 3D target segmentation technique based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which segments 3D consistent target masks in multi-view scene images and generates a preliminary target model. Moreover, to reconstruct the unseen portions of the target, we propose a novel target replenishment technique driven by large-scale generative diffusion priors. We demonstrate that our method can accurately reconstruct specific targets from large scenes, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our experiments show that OMEGAS significantly outperforms existing reconstruction methods across various scenarios.

| 447 | Splatt3R: Zero-shot Gaussian Splatting from Uncalibrated Image Pairs | Brandon Smart,Chuanxia Zheng,Iro Laina,Victor Adrian Prisacariu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we introduce Splatt3R, a pose-free, feed-forward method for in-the-wild 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis from stereo pairs. Given uncalibrated natural images, Splatt3R can predict 3D Gaussian Splats without requiring any camera parameters or depth information. For generalizability, we build Splatt3R upon a ``foundation'' 3D geometry reconstruction method, MASt3R, by extending it to deal with both 3D structure and appearance. Specifically, unlike the original MASt3R which reconstructs only 3D point clouds, we predict the additional Gaussian attributes required to construct a Gaussian primitive for each point. Hence, unlike other novel view synthesis methods, Splatt3R is first trained by optimizing the 3D point cloud's geometry loss, and then a novel view synthesis objective. By doing this, we avoid the local minima present in training 3D Gaussian Splats from stereo views. We also propose a novel loss masking strategy that we empirically find is critical for strong performance on extrapolated viewpoints. We train Splatt3R on the ScanNet++ dataset and demonstrate excellent generalisation to uncalibrated, in-the-wild images. Splatt3R can reconstruct scenes at 4FPS at 512 x 512 resolution, and the resultant splats can be rendered in real-time.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13912](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13912) |
| 446 | Drone-assisted Road Gaussian Splatting with Cross-view Uncertainty | Saining Zhang,Baijun Ye,Xiaoxue Chen,Yuantao Chen,Zongzheng Zhang,Cheng Peng,Yongliang Shi,Hao Zhao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Robust and realistic rendering for large-scale road scenes is essential in autonomous driving simulation. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has made groundbreaking progress in neural rendering, but the general fidelity of large-scale road scene renderings is often limited by the input imagery, which usually has a narrow field of view and focuses mainly on the street-level local area. Intuitively, the data from the drone's perspective can provide a complementary viewpoint for the data from the ground vehicle's perspective, enhancing the completeness of scene reconstruction and rendering. However, training naively with aerial and ground images, which exhibit large view disparity, poses a significant convergence challenge for 3D-GS, and does not demonstrate remarkable improvements in performance on road views. In order to enhance the novel view synthesis of road views and to effectively use the aerial information, we design an uncertainty-aware training method that allows aerial images to assist in the synthesis of areas where ground images have poor learning outcomes instead of weighting all pixels equally in 3D-GS training like prior work did. We are the first to introduce the cross-view uncertainty to 3D-GS by matching the car-view ensemble-based rendering uncertainty to aerial images, weighting the contribution of each pixel to the training process. Additionally, to systematically quantify evaluation metrics, we assemble a high-quality synthesized dataset comprising both aerial and ground images for road scenes.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15242](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15242) |

It plays an essential role in various applications such as Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), autonomous driving and robotics. Leveraging multiple views of a scene captured from different viewpoints, Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms synthesize a comprehensive 3D representation, enabling precise reconstruction in complex environments. Due to its efficiency and effectiveness, MVS has become a pivotal method for image-based 3D reconstruction. Recently, with the success of deep learning, many learning-based MVS methods have been proposed, achieving impressive performance against traditional methods. We categorize these learning-based methods as: depth map-based, voxel-based, NeRF-based, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based, and large feed-forward methods. Among these, we focus significantly on depth map-based methods, which are the main family of MVS due to their conciseness, flexibility and scalability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature at the time of this writing. We investigate these learning-based methods, summarize their performances on popular benchmarks, and discuss promising future research directions in this area.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15235](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15235) |
| 444 | Pano2Room: Novel View Synthesis from a Single Indoor Panorama | Guo Pu,Yiming Zhao,Zhouhui Lian | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent single-view 3D generative methods have made significant advancements by leveraging knowledge distilled from extensive 3D object datasets. However, challenges persist in the synthesis of 3D scenes from a single view, primarily due to the complexity of real-world environments and the limited availability of high-quality prior resources. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Pano2Room, designed to automatically reconstruct high-quality 3D indoor scenes from a single panoramic image. These panoramic images can be easily generated using a panoramic RGBD inpainter from captures at a single location with any camera. The key idea is to initially construct a preliminary mesh from the input panorama, and iteratively refine this mesh using a panoramic RGBD inpainter while collecting photo-realistic 3D-consistent pseudo novel views. Finally, the refined mesh is converted into a 3D Gaussian Splatting field and trained with the collected pseudo novel views. This pipeline enables the reconstruction of real-world 3D scenes, even in the presence of large occlusions, and facilitates the synthesis of photo-realistic novel views with detailed geometry. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of our method in single-panorama indoor novel synthesis compared to the state-of-the-art.

Concurrently, concerns have been raised about the limitations of this technology in aspects such as point cloud storage, performance, and robustness in sparse viewpoints, leading to various improvements. However, there has been a notable lack of attention to the fundamental problem of projection errors introduced by the local affine approximation inherent in the splatting itself, and the consequential impact of these errors on the quality of photo-realistic rendering. This paper addresses the projection error function of 3D Gaussian Splatting, commencing with the residual error from the first-order Taylor expansion of the projection function. The analysis establishes a correlation between the error and the Gaussian mean position. Subsequently, leveraging function optimization theory, this paper analyzes the function's minima to provide an optimal projection strategy for Gaussian Splatting referred to Optimal Gaussian Splatting, which can accommodate a variety of camera models. Experimental validation further confirms that this projection methodology reduces artifacts, resulting in a more convincingly realistic rendering.</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00752](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00752) |

| 439 | DynaSurfGS: Dynamic Surface Reconstruction with Planar-based Gaussian Splatting | Weiwei Cai,Weicai Ye,Peng Ye,Tong He,Tao Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Dynamic scene reconstruction has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its capabilities in high-quality and real-time rendering. Among various methodologies, constructing a 4D spatial-temporal representation, such as 4D-GS, has gained popularity for its high-quality rendered images. However, these methods often produce suboptimal surfaces, as the discrete 3D Gaussian point clouds fail to align with the object's surface precisely. To address this problem, we propose DynaSurfGS to achieve both photorealistic rendering and high-fidelity surface reconstruction of dynamic scenarios. Specifically, the DynaSurfGS framework first incorporates Gaussian features from 4D neural voxels with the planar-based Gaussian Splatting to facilitate precise surface reconstruction. It leverages normal regularization to enforce the smoothness of the surface of dynamic objects. It also incorporates the as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) constraint to maintain the approximate rigidity of local neighborhoods of 3D Gaussians between timesteps and ensure that adjacent 3D Gaussians remain closely aligned throughout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaSurfGS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both high-fidelity surface reconstruction and photorealistic rendering.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13972](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13972) |
| 438 | GSFusion: Online RGB-D Mapping Where Gaussian Splatting Meets TSDF Fusion | Jiaxin Wei,Stefan Leutenegger | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Traditional volumetric fusion algorithms preserve the spatial structure of 3D scenes, which is beneficial for many tasks in computer vision and robotics. However, they often lack realism in terms of visualization. Emerging 3D Gaussian splatting bridges this gap, but existing Gaussian-based reconstruction methods often suffer from artifacts and inconsistencies with the underlying 3D structure, and struggle with real-time optimization, unable to provide users with immediate feedback in high quality. One of the bottlenecks arises from the massive amount of Gaussian parameters that need to be updated during optimization. Instead of using 3D Gaussian as a standalone map representation, we incorporate it into a volumetric mapping system to take advantage of geometric information and propose to use a quadtree data structure on images to drastically reduce the number of splats initialized. In this way, we simultaneously generate a compact 3D Gaussian map with fewer artifacts and a volumetric map on the fly. Our method, GSFusion, significantly enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing rendering quality, as demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets.

However, the promising reconstruction performance of existing G-3DGS methods relies heavily on accurate multi-view feature matching, which is quite challenging. Especially for the scenes that have many non-overlapping areas between various views and contain numerous similar regions, the matching performance of existing methods is poor and the reconstruction precision is limited. To address this problem, we develop a strategy that utilizes a predicted depth confidence map to guide accurate local feature matching. In addition, we propose to utilize the knowledge of existing monocular depth estimation models as prior to boost the depth estimation precision in non-overlapping areas between views. Combining the proposed strategies, we present a novel G-3DGS method named TranSplat, which obtains the best performance on both the RealEstate10K and ACID benchmarks while maintaining competitive speed and presenting strong cross-dataset generalization ability.

However, these reconstructions often suffer from one or both of the following limitations: First, they typically represent scenes in low dynamic range (LDR), which restricts their use to evenly lit environments and hinders immersive viewing experiences. Secondly, their reliance on a pinhole camera model, assuming all scene elements are in focus in the input images, presents practical challenges and complicates refocusing during novel-view synthesis. Addressing these limitations, we present a lightweight method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes multi-view LDR images of a scene with varying exposure times, apertures, and focus distances as input to reconstruct a high-dynamic-range (HDR) radiance field. By incorporating analytical convolutions of Gaussians based on a thin-lens camera model as well as a tonemapping module, our reconstructions enable the rendering of HDR content with flexible refocusing capabilities. We demonstrate that our combined treatment of HDR and depth of field facilitates real-time cinematic rendering, outperforming the state of the art.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07329](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07329) |

A desired virtual 3D scene should 1) exhibit omnidirectional view consistency, and 2) allow for free exploration in complex scene hierarchies. Existing methods either rely on successive scene expansion via inpainting or employ panorama representation to represent large FOV scene environments. However, the generated scene suffers from semantic drift during expansion and is unable to handle occlusion among scene hierarchies. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LayerPano3D, a novel framework for full-view, explorable panoramic 3D scene generation from a single text prompt. Our key insight is to decompose a reference 2D panorama into multiple layers at different depth levels, where each layer reveals the unseen space from the reference views via diffusion prior. LayerPano3D comprises multiple dedicated designs: 1) we introduce a novel text-guided anchor view synthesis pipeline for high-quality, consistent panorama generation. 2) We pioneer the Layered 3D Panorama as underlying representation to manage complex scene hierarchies and lift it into 3D Gaussians to splat detailed 360-degree omnidirectional scenes with unconstrained viewing paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates state-of-the-art 3D panoramic scene in both full view consistency and immersive exploratory experience. We believe that LayerPano3D holds promise for advancing 3D panoramic scene creation with numerous applications.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13252](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13252) |
| 433 | SpecGaussian with Latent Features: A High-quality Modeling of the View-dependent Appearance for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Zhiru Wang,Shiyun Xie,Chengwei Pan,Guoping Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) method has achieved great success in novel view synthesis, providing real-time rendering while ensuring high-quality rendering results. However, this method faces challenges in modeling specular reflections and handling anisotropic appearance components, especially in dealing with view-dependent color under complex lighting conditions. Additionally, 3D-GS uses spherical harmonic to learn the color representation, which has limited ability to represent complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Lantent-SpecGS, an approach that utilizes a universal latent neural descriptor within each 3D Gaussian. This enables a more effective representation of 3D feature fields, including appearance and geometry. Moreover, two parallel CNNs are designed to decoder the splatting feature maps into diffuse color and specular color separately. A mask that depends on the viewpoint is learned to merge these two colors, resulting in the final rendered image. Experimental results demonstrate that our method obtains competitive performance in novel view synthesis and extends the ability of 3D-GS to handle intricate scenarios with specular reflections.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05868](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05868) |
| 432 | FLoD: Integrating Flexible Level of Detail into 3D Gaussian Splatting for Customizable Rendering | Yunji Seo,Young Sun Choi,Hyun Seung Son,Youngjung Uh | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves fast and high-quality renderings by using numerous small Gaussians, which leads to significant memory consumption. This reliance on a large number of Gaussians restricts the application of 3DGS-based models on low-cost devices due to memory limitations. However, simply reducing the number of Gaussians to accommodate devices with less memory capacity leads to inferior quality compared to the quality that can be achieved on high-end hardware. To address this lack of scalability, we propose integrating a Flexible Level of Detail (FLoD) to 3DGS, to allow a scene to be rendered at varying levels of detail according to hardware capabilities. While existing 3DGSs with LoD focus on detailed reconstruction, our method provides reconstructions using a small number of Gaussians for reduced memory requirements, and a larger number of Gaussians for greater detail. Experiments demonstrate our various rendering options with tradeoffs between rendering quality and memory usage, thereby allowing real-time rendering across different memory constraints. Furthermore, we show that our method generalizes to different 3DGS frameworks, indicating its potential for integration into future state-of-the-art developments.

| 431 | View-Consistent 3D Editing with Gaussian Splatting | Yuxuan Wang,Xuanyu Yi,Zike Wu,Na Zhao,Long Chen,Hanwang Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D editing, offering efficient, high-fidelity rendering and enabling precise local manipulations. Currently, diffusion-based 2D editing models are harnessed to modify multi-view rendered images, which then guide the editing of 3DGS models. However, this approach faces a critical issue of multi-view inconsistency, where the guidance images exhibit significant discrepancies across views, leading to mode collapse and visual artifacts of 3DGS. To this end, we introduce View-consistent Editing (VcEdit), a novel framework that seamlessly incorporates 3DGS into image editing processes, ensuring multi-view consistency in edited guidance images and effectively mitigating mode collapse issues. VcEdit employs two innovative consistency modules: the Cross-attention Consistency Module and the Editing Consistency Module, both designed to reduce inconsistencies in edited images. By incorporating these consistency modules into an iterative pattern, VcEdit proficiently resolves the issue of multi-view inconsistency, facilitating high-quality 3DGS editing across a diverse range of scenes. Further video results are shown in http://vcedit.github.io.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11868](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11868) |
| 430 | Semantic Gaussians: Open-Vocabulary Scene Understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Jun Guo,Xiaojian Ma,Yue Fan,Huaping Liu,Qing Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding presents a significant challenge in computer vision, with wide-ranging applications in embodied agents and augmented reality systems. Existing methods adopt neurel rendering methods as 3D representations and jointly optimize color and semantic features to achieve rendering and scene understanding simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce Semantic Gaussians, a novel open-vocabulary scene understanding approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to distill knowledge from 2D pre-trained models to 3D Gaussians. Unlike existing methods, we design a versatile projection approach that maps various 2D semantic features from pre-trained image encoders into a novel semantic component of 3D Gaussians, which is based on spatial relationship and need no additional training. We further build a 3D semantic network that directly predicts the semantic component from raw 3D Gaussians for fast inference. The quantitative results on ScanNet segmentation and LERF object localization demonstates the superior performance of our method. Additionally, we explore several applications of Semantic Gaussians including object part segmentation, instance segmentation, scene editing, and spatiotemporal segmentation with better qualitative results over 2D and 3D baselines, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness on supporting diverse downstream tasks.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15624](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15624) |
| 429 | Robust 3D Gaussian Splatting for Novel View Synthesis in Presence of Distractors | Paul Ungermann,Armin Ettenhofer,Matthias Nie\xc3\x9fner,Barbara Roessle | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting has shown impressive novel view synthesis results; nonetheless, it is vulnerable to dynamic objects polluting the input data of an otherwise static scene, so called distractors. Distractors have severe impact on the rendering quality as they get represented as view-dependent effects or result in floating artifacts. Our goal is to identify and ignore such distractors during the 3D Gaussian optimization to obtain a clean reconstruction. To this end, we take a self-supervised approach that looks at the image residuals during the optimization to determine areas that have likely been falsified by a distractor. In addition, we leverage a pretrained segmentation network to provide object awareness, enabling more accurate exclusion of distractors. This way, we obtain segmentation masks of distractors to effectively ignore them in the loss formulation. We demonstrate that our approach is robust to various distractors and strongly improves rendering quality on distractor-polluted scenes, improving PSNR by 1.86dB compared to 3D Gaussian Splatting.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11697](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11697) |
| 428 | Visual SLAM with 3D Gaussian Primitives and Depth Priors Enabling Novel View Synthesis | Zhongche Qu,Zhi Zhang,Cong Liu,Jianhua Yin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Conventional geometry-based SLAM systems lack dense 3D reconstruction capabilities since their data association usually relies on feature correspondences. Additionally, learning-based SLAM systems often fall short in terms of real-time performance and accuracy. Balancing real-time performance with dense 3D reconstruction capabilities is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a real-time RGB-D SLAM system that incorporates a novel view synthesis technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting, for 3D scene representation and pose estimation. This technique leverages the real-time rendering performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting with rasterization and allows for differentiable optimization in real time through CUDA implementation. We also enable mesh reconstruction from 3D Gaussians for explicit dense 3D reconstruction. To estimate accurate camera poses, we utilize a rotation-translation decoupled strategy with inverse optimization. This involves iteratively updating both in several iterations through gradient-based optimization. This process includes differentiably rendering RGB, depth, and silhouette maps and updating the camera parameters to minimize a combined loss of photometric loss, depth geometry loss, and visibility loss, given the existing 3D Gaussian map. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles to accurately represent surfaces due to the multi-view inconsistency of 3D Gaussians, which can lead to reduced accuracy in both camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction. To address this, we utilize depth priors as additional regularization to enforce geometric constraints, thereby improving the accuracy of both pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. We also provide extensive experimental results on public benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in terms of pose accuracy, geometric accuracy, and rendering performance.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05635](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05635) |
| 427 | TrAME: Trajectory-Anchored Multi-View Editing for Text-Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting Manipulation | Chaofan Luo,Donglin Di,Xun Yang,Yongjia Ma,Zhou Xue,Chen Wei,Yebin Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Despite significant strides in the field of 3D scene editing, current methods encounter substantial challenge, particularly in preserving 3D consistency in multi-view editing process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the complete codebase publicly available following the conclusion of the review process.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02034](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02034) |
| 426 | InstantSplat: Sparse-view SfM-free Gaussian Splatting in Seconds | Zhiwen Fan,Wenyan Cong,Kairun Wen,Kevin Wang,Jian Zhang,Xinghao Ding,Danfei Xu,Boris Ivanovic,Marco Pavone,Georgios Pavlakos,Zhangyang Wang,Yue Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>While novel view synthesis (NVS) from a sparse set of images has advanced significantly in 3D computer vision, it relies on precise initial estimation of camera parameters using Structure-from-Motion (SfM). For instance, the recently developed Gaussian Splatting depends heavily on the accuracy of SfM-derived points and poses. However, SfM processes are time-consuming and often prove unreliable in sparse-view scenarios, where matched features are scarce, leading to accumulated errors and limited generalization capability across datasets. In this study, we introduce a novel and efficient framework to enhance robust NVS from sparse-view images. Our framework, InstantSplat, integrates multi-view stereo(MVS) predictions with point-based representations to construct 3D Gaussians of large-scale scenes from sparse-view data within seconds, addressing the aforementioned performance and efficiency issues by SfM. Specifically, InstantSplat generates densely populated surface points across all training views and determines the initial camera parameters using pixel-alignment. Nonetheless, the MVS points are not globally accurate, and the pixel-wise prediction from all views results in an excessive Gaussian number, yielding a overparameterized scene representation that compromises both training speed and accuracy. To address this issue, we employ a grid-based, confidence-aware Farthest Point Sampling to strategically position point primitives at representative locations in parallel. Next, we enhance pose accuracy and tune scene parameters through a gradient-based joint optimization framework from self-supervision. By employing this simplified framework, InstantSplat achieves a substantial reduction in training time, from hours to mere seconds, and demonstrates robust performance across various numbers of views in diverse datasets.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20309](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20309) |

This calls for the 3D understanding directly in this representation space. To facilitate the research in this direction, we first build a large-scale dataset of 3DGS using the commonly used ShapeNet and ModelNet datasets. Our dataset ShapeSplat consists of 65K objects from 87 unique categories, whose labels are in accordance with the respective datasets. The creation of this dataset utilized the compute equivalent of 2 GPU years on a TITAN XP GPU.  We utilize our dataset for unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning for classification and segmentation tasks. To this end, we introduce \\textbf{\\textit{Gaussian-MAE}}, which highlights the unique benefits of representation learning from Gaussian parameters. Through exhaustive experiments, we provide several valuable insights. In particular, we show that (1) the distribution of the optimized GS centroids significantly differs from the uniformly sampled point cloud (used for initialization) counterpart; (2) this change in distribution results in degradation in classification but improvement in segmentation tasks when using only the centroids; (3) to leverage additional Gaussian parameters, we propose Gaussian feature grouping in a normalized feature space, along with splats pooling layer, offering a tailored solution to effectively group and embed similar Gaussians, which leads to notable improvement in finetuning tasks.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10906](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10906) |
| 424 | Gaussian in the Dark: Real-Time View Synthesis From Inconsistent Dark Images Using Gaussian Splatting | Sheng Ye,Zhen-Hui Dong,Yubin Hu,Yu-Hui Wen,Yong-Jin Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as a powerful representation that can synthesize remarkable novel views using consistent multi-view images as input. However, we notice that images captured in dark environments where the scenes are not fully illuminated can exhibit considerable brightness variations and multi-view inconsistency, which poses great challenges to 3D Gaussian Splatting and severely degrades its performance. To tackle this problem, we propose Gaussian-DK. Observing that inconsistencies are mainly caused by camera imaging, we represent a consistent radiance field of the physical world using a set of anisotropic 3D Gaussians, and design a camera response module to compensate for multi-view inconsistencies. We also introduce a step-based gradient scaling strategy to constrain Gaussians near the camera, which turn out to be floaters, from splitting and cloning. Experiments on our proposed benchmark dataset demonstrate that Gaussian-DK produces high-quality renderings without ghosting and floater artifacts and significantly outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, we can also synthesize light-up images by controlling exposure levels that clearly show details in shadow areas.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09130](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09130) |
| 423 | DynaPix SLAM: A Pixel-Based Dynamic Visual SLAM Approach | Chenghao Xu,Elia Bonetto,Aamir Ahmad | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (V-SLAM) methods achieve remarkable performance in static environments, but face challenges in dynamic scenes where moving objects severely affect their core modules. To avoid this, dynamic V-SLAM approaches often leverage semantic information, geometric constraints, or optical flow. However, these methods are limited by imprecise estimations and their reliance on the accuracy of deep-learning models. Moreover, predefined thresholds for static/dynamic classification, the a-priori selection of dynamic object classes, and the inability to recognize unknown or unexpected moving objects, often degrade their performance. To address these limitations, we introduce DynaPix, a novel semantic-free V-SLAM system based on per-pixel motion probability estimation and an improved pose optimization process. The per-pixel motion probability is estimated using a static background differencing method on image data and optical flows computed on splatted frames. With DynaPix, we fully integrate these probabilities into map point selection and apply them through weighted bundle adjustment within the tracking and optimization modules of ORB-SLAM2. We thoroughly evaluate our method using the GRADE and TUM RGB-D datasets, showing significantly lower trajectory errors and longer tracking times in both static and dynamic sequences.

We present DEGAS, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based modeling method for full-body avatars with rich facial expressions. Trained on multiview videos of a given subject, our method learns a conditional variational autoencoder that takes both the body motion and facial expression as driving signals to generate Gaussian maps in the UV layout. To drive the facial expressions, instead of the commonly used 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) in 3D head avatars, we propose to adopt the expression latent space trained solely on 2D portrait images, bridging the gap between 2D talking faces and 3D avatars. Leveraging the rendering capability of 3DGS and the rich expressiveness of the expression latent space, the learned avatars can be reenacted to reproduce photorealistic rendering images with subtle and accurate facial expressions. Experiments on an existing dataset and our newly proposed dataset of full-body talking avatars demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We also propose an audio-driven extension of our method with the help of 2D talking faces, opening new possibilities to interactive AI agents.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10588](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10588) |

However, existing 3DGS-based methods fail to address the global consistency of the scene via loop closure and/or global bundle adjustment. To this end, we propose LoopSplat, which takes RGB-D images as input and performs dense mapping with 3DGS submaps and frame-to-model tracking. LoopSplat triggers loop closure online and computes relative loop edge constraints between submaps directly via 3DGS registration, leading to improvements in efficiency and accuracy over traditional global-to-local point cloud registration. It uses a robust pose graph optimization formulation and rigidly aligns the submaps to achieve global consistency. Evaluation on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD, ScanNet, and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrates competitive or superior tracking, mapping, and rendering compared to existing methods for dense RGB-D SLAM.

| 420 | CHASE: 3D-Consistent Human Avatars with Sparse Inputs via Gaussian Splatting and Contrastive Learning | Haoyu Zhao,Hao Wang,Chen Yang,Wei Shen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in human avatar synthesis have utilized radiance fields to reconstruct photo-realistic animatable human avatars. However, both NeRFs-based and 3DGS-based methods struggle with maintaining 3D consistency and exhibit suboptimal detail reconstruction, especially with sparse inputs. To address this challenge, we propose CHASE, which introduces supervision from intrinsic 3D consistency across poses and 3D geometry contrastive learning, achieving performance comparable with sparse inputs to that with full inputs. Following previous work, we first integrate a skeleton-driven rigid deformation and a non-rigid cloth dynamics deformation to coordinate the movements of individual Gaussians during animation, reconstructing basic avatar with coarse 3D consistency. To improve 3D consistency under sparse inputs, we design Dynamic Avatar Adjustment(DAA) to adjust deformed Gaussians based on a selected similar pose/image from the dataset. Minimizing the difference between the image rendered by adjusted Gaussians and the image with the similar pose serves as an additional form of supervision for avatar. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geometry contrastive learning strategy to maintain the 3D global consistency of generated avatars. Though CHASE is designed for sparse inputs, it surprisingly outperforms current SOTA methods \\textbf{in both full and sparse settings} on the ZJU-MoCap and H36M datasets, demonstrating that our CHASE successfully maintains avatar's 3D consistency, hence improving rendering quality.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09663](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09663) |

This architecture features 2D feature grids at various resolutions across different levels, facilitating continuous spatial domain representation and enhancing spatial correlations among Gaussian primitives. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a level-based progressive training scheme, which incorporates explicit spatial regularization. This method capitalizes on spatial correlations to enhance both the rendering quality and the compactness of the IGS representation. Furthermore, we propose a novel compression pipeline tailored for both point clouds and 2D feature grids, considering the entropy variations across different levels.

Recently, methods using 3D Gaussians to represent the human body have emerged, offering faster optimization and real-time rendering. However, due to ignoring the crucial role of human body semantic information which represents the intrinsic structure and connections within the human body, they fail to achieve fine-detail reconstruction of dynamic human avatars. To address this issue, we propose SG-GS, which uses semantics-embedded 3D Gaussians, skeleton-driven rigid deformation, and non-rigid cloth dynamics deformation to create photo-realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos. We then design a Semantic Human-Body Annotator (SHA) which utilizes SMPL's semantic prior for efficient body part semantic labeling. The generated labels are used to guide the optimization of Gaussian semantic attributes. To address the limited receptive field of point-level MLPs for local features, we also propose a 3D network that integrates geometric and semantic associations for human avatar deformation. We further implement three key strategies to enhance the semantic accuracy of 3D Gaussians and rendering quality: semantic projection with 2D regularization, semantic-guided density regularization and semantic-aware regularization with neighborhood consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SG-GS achieves state-of-the-art geometry and appearance reconstruction performance.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09665](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09665) |

Recent methods extend NeRF by incorporating tracked vehicle poses to animate vehicles, enabling photo-realistic view synthesis of dynamic urban street scenes. However, significant limitations are their slow training and rendering speed. We introduce Street Gaussians, a new explicit scene representation that tackles these limitations. Specifically, the dynamic urban scene is represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic logits and 3D Gaussians, each associated with either a foreground vehicle or the background. To model the dynamics of foreground object vehicles, each object point cloud is optimized with optimizable tracked poses, along with a 4D spherical harmonics model for the dynamic appearance. The explicit representation allows easy composition of object vehicles and background, which in turn allows for scene editing operations and rendering at 135 FPS (1066 $\\times$ 1600 resolution) within half an hour of training. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple challenging benchmarks, including KITTI and Waymo Open datasets. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all datasets.

This paper introduces a novel neural rendering method termed Decoupled Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (DHGS), targeting at promoting the rendering quality of novel view synthesis for static driving scenes. The novelty of this work lies in the decoupled and hybrid pixel-level blender for road and non-road layers, without the conventional unified differentiable rendering logic for the entire scene. Still, consistency and continuity in superimposition are preserved through the proposed depth-ordered hybrid rendering strategy. Additionally, an implicit road representation comprised of a Signed Distance Function (SDF) is trained to supervise the road surface with subtle geometric attributes. Accompanied by the use of auxiliary transmittance loss and consistency loss, novel images with imperceptible boundary and elevated fidelity are ultimately obtained.

Current methods struggle to provide comprehensive and accurate 3D reconstructions of the colonic surface which can help minimize the missing regions and reinspection for pre-cancerous polyps. Addressing this, we introduce 'Gaussian Pancakes', a method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) combined with a Recurrent Neural Network-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (RNNSLAM) system. By introducing geometric and depth regularization into the 3D GS framework, our approach ensures more accurate alignment of Gaussians with the colon surface, resulting in smoother 3D reconstructions with novel viewing of detailed textures and structures. Evaluations across three diverse datasets show that Gaussian Pancakes enhances novel view synthesis quality, surpassing current leading methods with a 18% boost in PSNR and a 16% improvement in SSIM.

| 412 | Correspondence-Guided SfM-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting for NVS | Wei Sun,Xiaosong Zhang,Fang Wan,Yanzhao Zhou,Yuan Li,Qixiang Ye,Jianbin Jiao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel View Synthesis (NVS) without Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pre-processed camera poses--referred to as SfM-free methods--is crucial for promoting rapid response capabilities and enhancing robustness against variable operating conditions. Recent SfM-free methods have integrated pose optimization, designing end-to-end frameworks for joint camera pose estimation and NVS. However, most existing works rely on per-pixel image loss functions, such as L2 loss. In SfM-free methods, inaccurate initial poses lead to misalignment issue, which, under the constraints of per-pixel image loss functions, results in excessive gradients, causing unstable optimization and poor convergence for NVS. In this study, we propose a correspondence-guided SfM-free 3D Gaussian splatting for NVS. We use correspondences between the target and the rendered result to achieve better pixel alignment, facilitating the optimization of relative poses between frames. We then apply the learned poses to optimize the entire scene. Each 2D screen-space pixel is associated with its corresponding 3D Gaussians through approximated surface rendering to facilitate gradient back propagation. Experimental results underline the superior performance and time efficiency of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08723](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08723) |
| 411 | GS-ID: Illumination Decomposition on Gaussian Splatting via Diffusion Prior and Parametric Light Source Optimization | Kang Du,Zhihao Liang,Zeyu Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present GS-ID, a novel framework for illumination decomposition on Gaussian Splatting, achieving photorealistic novel view synthesis and intuitive light editing. Illumination decomposition is an ill-posed problem facing three main challenges: 1) priors for geometry and material are often lacking; 2) complex illumination conditions involve multiple unknown light sources; and 3) calculating surface shading with numerous light sources is computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we first introduce intrinsic diffusion priors to estimate the attributes for physically based rendering. Then we divide the illumination into environmental and direct components for joint optimization. Last, we employ deferred rendering to reduce the computational load. Our framework uses a learnable environment map and Spherical Gaussians (SGs) to represent light sources parametrically, therefore enabling controllable and photorealistic relighting on Gaussian Splatting. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate that GS-ID produces state-of-the-art illumination decomposition results while achieving better geometry reconstruction and rendering performance.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08524](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08524) |
| 410 | Touch-GS: Visual-Tactile Supervised 3D Gaussian Splatting | Aiden Swann,Matthew Strong,Won Kyung Do,Gadiel Sznaier Camps,Mac Schwager,Monroe Kennedy III | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this work, we propose a novel method to supervise 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scenes using optical tactile sensors. Optical tactile sensors have become widespread in their use in robotics for manipulation and object representation; however, raw optical tactile sensor data is unsuitable to directly supervise a 3DGS scene. Our representation leverages a Gaussian Process Implicit Surface to implicitly represent the object, combining many touches into a unified representation with uncertainty. We merge this model with a monocular depth estimation network, which is aligned in a two stage process, coarsely aligning with a depth camera and then finely adjusting to match our touch data. For every training image, our method produces a corresponding fused depth and uncertainty map. Utilizing this additional information, we propose a new loss function, variance weighted depth supervised loss, for training the 3DGS scene model. We leverage the DenseTact optical tactile sensor and RealSense RGB-D camera to show that combining touch and vision in this manner leads to quantitatively and qualitatively better results than vision or touch alone in a few-view scene syntheses on opaque as well as on reflective and transparent objects.

| 409 | WaterSplatting: Fast Underwater 3D Scene Reconstruction Using Gaussian Splatting | Huapeng Li,Wenxuan Song,Tianao Xu,Alexandre Elsig,Jonas Kulhanek | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The underwater 3D scene reconstruction is a challenging, yet interesting problem with applications ranging from naval robots to VR experiences. The problem was successfully tackled by fully volumetric NeRF-based methods which can model both the geometry and the medium (water). Unfortunately, these methods are slow to train and do not offer real-time rendering. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method offered a fast alternative to NeRFs. However, because it is an explicit method that renders only the geometry, it cannot render the medium and is therefore unsuited for underwater reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a novel approach that fuses volumetric rendering with 3DGS to handle underwater data effectively. Our method employs 3DGS for explicit geometry representation and a separate volumetric field (queried once per pixel) for capturing the scattering medium. This dual representation further allows the restoration of the scenes by removing the scattering medium. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods in rendering quality on the underwater SeaThru-NeRF dataset. Furthermore, it does so while offering real-time rendering performance, addressing the efficiency limitations of existing methods.

| 408 | Dual-Camera Smooth Zoom on Mobile Phones | Renlong Wu,Zhilu Zhang,Yu Yang,Wangmeng Zuo | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>When zooming between dual cameras on a mobile, noticeable jumps in geometric content and image color occur in the preview, inevitably affecting the user's zoom experience. In this work, we introduce a new task, ie, dual-camera smooth zoom (DCSZ) to achieve a smooth zoom preview. The frame interpolation (FI) technique is a potential solution but struggles with ground-truth collection. To address the issue, we suggest a data factory solution where continuous virtual cameras are assembled to generate DCSZ data by rendering reconstructed 3D models of the scene. In particular, we propose a novel dual-camera smooth zoom Gaussian Splatting (ZoomGS), where a camera-specific encoding is introduced to construct a specific 3D model for each virtual camera. With the proposed data factory, we construct a synthetic dataset for DCSZ, and we utilize it to fine-tune FI models. In addition, we collect real-world dual-zoom images without ground-truth for evaluation. Extensive experiments are conducted with multiple FI methods. The results show that the fine-tuned FI models achieve a significant performance improvement over the original ones on DCSZ task. The datasets, codes, and pre-trained models will are available at https://github.com/ZcsrenlongZ/ZoomGS.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04908](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04908) |
| 407 | Progressive Radiance Distillation for Inverse Rendering with Gaussian Splatting | Keyang Ye,Qiming Hou,Kun Zhou | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose progressive radiance distillation, an inverse rendering method that combines physically-based rendering with Gaussian-based radiance field rendering using a distillation progress map. Taking multi-view images as input, our method starts from a pre-trained radiance field guidance, and distills physically-based light and material parameters from the radiance field using an image-fitting process. The distillation progress map is initialized to a small value, which favors radiance field rendering. During early iterations when fitted light and material parameters are far from convergence, the radiance field fallback ensures the sanity of image loss gradients and avoids local minima that attracts under-fit states. As fitted parameters converge, the physical model gradually takes over and the distillation progress increases correspondingly. In presence of light paths unmodeled by the physical model, the distillation progress never finishes on affected pixels and the learned radiance field stays in the final rendering. With this designed tolerance for physical model limitations, we prevent unmodeled color components from leaking into light and material parameters, alleviating relighting artifacts. Meanwhile, the remaining radiance field compensates for the limitations of the physical model, guaranteeing high-quality novel views synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques quality-wise in both novel view synthesis and relighting. The idea of progressive radiance distillation is not limited to Gaussian splatting. We show that it also has positive effects for prominently specular scenes when adapted to a mesh-based inverse rendering method.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07595](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07595) |
| 406 | GS-Pose: Generalizable Segmentation-based 6D Object Pose Estimation with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Dingding Cai,Janne Heikkil\xc3\xa4,Esa Rahtu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper introduces GS-Pose, a unified framework for localizing and estimating the 6D pose of novel objects. GS-Pose begins with a set of posed RGB images of a previously unseen object and builds three distinct representations stored in a database. At inference, GS-Pose operates sequentially by locating the object in the input image, estimating its initial 6D pose using a retrieval approach, and refining the pose with a render-and-compare method. The key insight is the application of the appropriate object representation at each stage of the process. In particular, for the refinement step, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting, a novel differentiable rendering technique that offers high rendering speed and relatively low optimization time. Off-the-shelf toolchains and commodity hardware, such as mobile phones, can be used to capture new objects to be added to the database. Extensive evaluations on the LINEMOD and OnePose-LowTexture datasets demonstrate excellent performance, establishing the new state-of-the-art.

| 405 | 3D Gaussian Editing with A Single Image | Guan Luo,Tian-Xing Xu,Ying-Tian Liu,Xiao-Xiong Fan,Fang-Lue Zhang,Song-Hai Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The modeling and manipulation of 3D scenes captured from the real world are pivotal in various applications, attracting growing research interest. While previous works on editing have achieved interesting results through manipulating 3D meshes, they often require accurately reconstructed meshes to perform editing, which limits their application in 3D content generation. To address this gap, we introduce a novel single-image-driven 3D scene editing approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling intuitive manipulation via directly editing the content on a 2D image plane. Our method learns to optimize the 3D Gaussians to align with an edited version of the image rendered from a user-specified viewpoint of the original scene. To capture long-range object deformation, we introduce positional loss into the optimization process of 3D Gaussian Splatting and enable gradient propagation through reparameterization. To handle occluded 3D Gaussians when rendering from the specified viewpoint, we build an anchor-based structure and employ a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy capable of handling long-range deformation while maintaining structural stability. Furthermore, we design a novel masking strategy to adaptively identify non-rigid deformation regions for fine-scale modeling. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in handling geometric details, long-range, and non-rigid deformation, demonstrating superior editing flexibility and quality compared to previous approaches.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07540](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07540) |
| 404 | Self-augmented Gaussian Splatting with Structure-aware Masks for Sparse-view 3D Reconstruction | Lingbei Meng,Bi'an Du,Wei Hu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Sparse-view 3D reconstruction stands as a formidable challenge in computer vision, aiming to build complete three-dimensional models from a limited array of viewing perspectives. This task confronts several difficulties: 1) the limited number of input images that lack consistent information; 2) dependence on the quality of input images; and 3) the substantial size of model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a self-augmented coarse-to-fine Gaussian splatting paradigm, enhanced with a structure-aware mask, for sparse-view 3D reconstruction. In particular, our method initially employs a coarse Gaussian model to obtain a basic 3D representation from sparse-view inputs. Subsequently, we develop a fine Gaussian network to enhance consistent and detailed representation of the output with both 3D geometry augmentation and perceptual view augmentation. During training, we design a structure-aware masking strategy to further improve the model's robustness against sparse inputs and noise.Experimental results on the MipNeRF360 and OmniObject3D datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances for sparse input views in both perceptual quality and efficiency.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04831](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04831) |

We develop a procedure to convert back and forth between the two. Our approach achieves the best of both NeRFs (superior PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS on dissimilar views, and a compact representation) and GS (real-time rendering and ability for easily modifying the representation); the computational cost of these conversions is minor compared to training the two from scratch.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09717](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09717) |

Our work also demonstrates the potential of spectral scene understanding for precise scene editing techniques like style transfer, inpainting, and removal.

| 400 | StylizedGS: Controllable Stylization for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Dingxi Zhang,Yu-Jie Yuan,Zhuoxun Chen,Fang-Lue Zhang,Zhenliang He,Shiguang Shan,Lin Gao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>As XR technology continues to advance rapidly, 3D generation and editing are increasingly crucial. Among these, stylization plays a key role in enhancing the appearance of 3D models. By utilizing stylization, users can achieve consistent artistic effects in 3D editing using a single reference style image, making it a user-friendly editing method. However, recent NeRF-based 3D stylization methods encounter efficiency issues that impact the user experience, and their implicit nature limits their ability to accurately transfer geometric pattern styles. Additionally, the ability for artists to apply flexible control over stylized scenes is considered highly desirable to foster an environment conducive to creative exploration. To address the above issues, we introduce StylizedGS, an efficient 3D neural style transfer framework with adaptable control over perceptual factors based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. We propose a filter-based refinement to eliminate floaters that affect the stylization effects in the scene reconstruction process. The nearest neighbor-based style loss is introduced to achieve stylization by fine-tuning the geometry and color parameters of 3DGS, while a depth preservation loss with other regularizations is proposed to prevent the tampering of geometry content. Moreover, facilitated by specially designed losses, StylizedGS enables users to control color, stylized scale, and regions during the stylization to possess customization capabilities. Our method achieves high-quality stylization results characterized by faithful brushstrokes and geometric consistency with flexible controls. Extensive experiments across various scenes and styles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method concerning both stylization quality and inference speed.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05220](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05220) |
| 399 | Mipmap-GS: Let Gaussians Deform with Scale-specific Mipmap for Anti-aliasing Rendering | Jiameng Li,Yue Shi,Jiezhang Cao,Bingbing Ni,Wenjun Zhang,Kai Zhang,Luc Van Gool | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted great attention in novel view synthesis because of its superior rendering efficiency and high fidelity. However, the trained Gaussians suffer from severe zooming degradation due to non-adjustable representation derived from single-scale training. Though some methods attempt to tackle this problem via post-processing techniques such as selective rendering or filtering techniques towards primitives, the scale-specific information is not involved in Gaussians. In this paper, we propose a unified optimization method to make Gaussians adaptive for arbitrary scales by self-adjusting the primitive properties (e.g., color, shape and size) and distribution (e.g., position). Inspired by the mipmap technique, we design pseudo ground-truth for the target scale and propose a scale-consistency guidance loss to inject scale information into 3D Gaussians. Our method is a plug-in module, applicable for any 3DGS models to solve the zoom-in and zoom-out aliasing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, our method outperforms 3DGS in PSNR by an average of 9.25 dB for zoom-in and 10.40 dB for zoom-out on the NeRF Synthetic dataset.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06286](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06286) |

Traditional manual operation of drones in GPS-denied environments, such as industrial facilities and infrastructure, is labour-intensive, tedious and prone to error. This study presents an innovative framework for smart MAV inspections in such complex and GPS-denied indoor environments. The framework features a hierarchical perception and planning system that identifies regions of interest and optimises task paths. It also presents an advanced MAV system with enhanced localisation and motion planning capabilities, integrated with Neural Reconstruction technology for comprehensive 3D reconstruction of building structures.

Our approach effectively captures these priors by utilizing a Gaussian Splatting-based auto-decoder network with part-based dynamic modeling. Our method employs identity-shared encoding with personalized latent codes for individual identities to learn the attributes of Gaussian primitives. During the avatar creation phase, we achieve fast head avatar personalization by leveraging inversion and fine-tuning strategies.

However, it is a challenging task to achieve high quality, efficiency and zero-shot ability at the same time with semantics in radiance fields. In this work, we present FastLGS, an approach that supports real-time open-vocabulary query within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under high resolution. We propose the semantic feature grid to save multi-view CLIP features which are extracted based on Segment Anything Model (SAM) masks, and map the grids to low dimensional features for semantic field training through 3DGS. Once trained, we can restore pixel-aligned CLIP embeddings through feature grids from rendered features for open-vocabulary queries. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods prove that FastLGS can achieve the first place performance concerning both speed and accuracy, where FastLGS is 98x faster than LERF and 4x faster than LangSplat.

| 392 | GaussianForest: Hierarchical-Hybrid 3D Gaussian Splatting for Compressed Scene Modeling | Fengyi Zhang,Yadan Luo,Tianjun Zhang,Lin Zhang,Zi Huang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The field of novel-view synthesis has recently witnessed the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting, which represents scenes in a point-based manner and renders through rasterization. This methodology, in contrast to Radiance Fields that rely on ray tracing, demonstrates superior rendering quality and speed. However, the explicit and unstructured nature of 3D Gaussians poses a significant storage challenge, impeding its broader application. To address this challenge, we introduce the Gaussian-Forest modeling framework, which hierarchically represents a scene as a forest of hybrid 3D Gaussians. Each hybrid Gaussian retains its unique explicit attributes while sharing implicit ones with its sibling Gaussians, thus optimizing parameterization with significantly fewer variables. Moreover, adaptive growth and pruning strategies are designed, ensuring detailed representation in complex regions and a notable reduction in the number of required Gaussians. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian-Forest not only maintains comparable speed and quality but also achieves a compression rate surpassing 10 times, marking a significant advancement in efficient scene modeling.

To address these issues, we propose integrating 3DGS with Direct Sparse Odometry, a monocular photometric SLAM system. We have done preliminary experiments showing that using Direct Sparse Odometry point cloud outputs, as opposed to standard structure-from-motion methods, significantly shortens the training time needed to achieve high-quality renders. Reducing 3DGS training time enables the development of 3DGS-integrated SLAM systems that operate in real-time on mobile hardware. These promising initial findings suggest further exploration is warranted in combining traditional VSLAM systems with 3DGS.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03825](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03825) |
| 389 | Compact 3D Gaussian Splatting for Static and Dynamic Radiance Fields | Joo Chan Lee,Daniel Rho,Xiangyu Sun,Jong Hwan Ko,Eunbyung Park | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an alternative representation that leverages a 3D Gaussian-based representation and introduces an approximated volumetric rendering, achieving very fast rendering speed and promising image quality. Furthermore, subsequent studies have successfully extended 3DGS to dynamic 3D scenes, demonstrating its wide range of applications. However, a significant drawback arises as 3DGS and its following methods entail a substantial number of Gaussians to maintain the high fidelity of the rendered images, which requires a large amount of memory and storage. To address this critical issue, we place a specific emphasis on two key objectives: reducing the number of Gaussian points without sacrificing performance and compressing the Gaussian attributes, such as view-dependent color and covariance. To this end, we propose a learnable mask strategy that significantly reduces the number of Gaussians while preserving high performance. In addition, we propose a compact but effective representation of view-dependent color by employing a grid-based neural field rather than relying on spherical harmonics. Finally, we learn codebooks to compactly represent the geometric and temporal attributes by residual vector quantization. With model compression techniques such as quantization and entropy coding, we consistently show over 25x reduced storage and enhanced rendering speed compared to 3DGS for static scenes, while maintaining the quality of the scene representation. For dynamic scenes, our approach achieves more than 12x storage efficiency and retains a high-quality reconstruction compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for 3D scene representation, achieving high performance, fast training, compactness, and real-time rendering.

| 388 | 3iGS: Factorised Tensorial Illumination for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Zhe Jun Tang,Tat-Jen Cham | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The use of 3D Gaussians as representation of radiance fields has enabled high quality novel view synthesis at real-time rendering speed. However, the choice of optimising the outgoing radiance of each Gaussian independently as spherical harmonics results in unsatisfactory view dependent effects. In response to these limitations, our work, Factorised Tensorial Illumination for 3D Gaussian Splatting, or 3iGS, improves upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering quality. Instead of optimising a single outgoing radiance parameter, 3iGS enhances 3DGS view-dependent effects by expressing the outgoing radiance as a function of a local illumination field and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) features. We optimise a continuous incident illumination field through a Tensorial Factorisation representation, while separately fine-tuning the BRDF features of each 3D Gaussian relative to this illumination field. Our methodology significantly enhances the rendering quality of specular view-dependent effects of 3DGS, while maintaining rapid training and rendering speeds.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03753](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03753) |
| 387 | IG-SLAM: Instant Gaussian SLAM | F. Aykut Sarikamis,A. Aydin Alatan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting has recently shown promising results as an alternative scene representation in SLAM systems to neural implicit representations. However, current methods either lack dense depth maps to supervise the mapping process or detailed training designs that consider the scale of the environment. To address these drawbacks, we present IG-SLAM, a dense RGB-only SLAM system that employs robust Dense-SLAM methods for tracking and combines them with Gaussian Splatting. A 3D map of the environment is constructed using accurate pose and dense depth provided by tracking. Additionally, we utilize depth uncertainty in map optimization to improve 3D reconstruction. Our decay strategy in map optimization enhances convergence and allows the system to run at 10 fps in a single process. We demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art RGB-only SLAM systems while achieving faster operation speeds. We present our experiments on the Replica, TUM-RGBD, ScanNet, and EuRoC datasets. The system achieves photo-realistic 3D reconstruction in large-scale sequences, particularly in the EuRoC dataset.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01126](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01126) |
| 386 | PRTGS: Precomputed Radiance Transfer of Gaussian Splats for Real-Time High-Quality Relighting | Yijia Guo,Yuanxi Bai,Liwen Hu,Ziyi Guo,Mianzhi Liu,Yu Cai,Tiejun Huang,Lei Ma | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We proposed Precomputed RadianceTransfer of GaussianSplats (PRTGS), a real-time high-quality relighting method for Gaussian splats in low-frequency lighting environments that captures soft shadows and interreflections by precomputing 3D Gaussian splats' radiance transfer. Existing studies have demonstrated that 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) outperforms neural fields' efficiency for dynamic lighting scenarios. However, the current relighting method based on 3DGS still struggles to compute high-quality shadow and indirect illumination in real time for dynamic light, leading to unrealistic rendering results. We solve this problem by precomputing the expensive transport simulations required for complex transfer functions like shadowing, the resulting transfer functions are represented as dense sets of vectors or matrices for every Gaussian splat. We introduce distinct precomputing methods tailored for training and rendering stages, along with unique ray tracing and indirect lighting precomputation techniques for 3D Gaussian splats to accelerate training speed and compute accurate indirect lighting related to environment light. Experimental analyses demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and allows high-quality real-time (30+ fps) relighting for dynamic light and relatively complex scenes at 1080p resolution.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03538](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03538) |
| 385 | LumiGauss: High-Fidelity Outdoor Relighting with 2D Gaussian Splatting | Joanna Kaleta,Kacper Kania,Tomasz Trzcinski,Marek Kowalski | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Decoupling lighting from geometry using unconstrained photo collections is notoriously challenging. Solving it would benefit many users, as creating complex 3D assets takes days of manual labor. Many previous works have attempted to address this issue, often at the expense of output fidelity, which questions the practicality of such methods.  We introduce LumiGauss, a technique that tackles 3D reconstruction of scenes and environmental lighting through 2D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach yields high-quality scene reconstructions and enables realistic lighting synthesis under novel environment maps. We also propose a method for enhancing the quality of shadows, common in outdoor scenes, by exploiting spherical harmonics properties. Our approach facilitates seamless integration with game engines and enables the use of fast precomputed radiance transfer.  We validate our method on the NeRF-OSR dataset, demonstrating superior performance over baseline methods. Moreover, LumiGauss can synthesize realistic images when applying novel environment maps.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04474](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04474) |
| 384 | RayGauss: Volumetric Gaussian-Based Ray Casting for Photorealistic Novel View Synthesis | Hugo Blanc,Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud,Alexis Paljic | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Differentiable volumetric rendering-based methods made significant progress in novel view synthesis. On one hand, innovative methods have replaced the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) network with locally parameterized structures, enabling high-quality renderings in a reasonable time. On the other hand, approaches have used differentiable splatting instead of NeRF's ray casting to optimize radiance fields rapidly using Gaussian kernels, allowing for fine adaptation to the scene. However, differentiable ray casting of irregularly spaced kernels has been scarcely explored, while splatting, despite enabling fast rendering times, is susceptible to clearly visible artifacts.  Our work closes this gap by providing a physically consistent formulation of the emitted radiance c and density \xcf\x83, decomposed with Gaussian functions associated with Spherical Gaussians/Harmonics for all-frequency colorimetric representation. We also introduce a method enabling differentiable ray casting of irregularly distributed Gaussians using an algorithm that integrates radiance fields slab by slab and leverages a BVH structure. This allows our approach to finely adapt to the scene while avoiding splatting artifacts. As a result, we achieve superior rendering quality compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining reasonable training times and achieving inference speeds of 25 FPS on the Blender dataset.

| 383 | Reinforcement Learning with Generalizable Gaussian Splatting | Jiaxu Wang,Qiang Zhang,Jingkai Sun,Jiahang Cao,Gang Han,Wen Zhao,Weining Zhang,Yecheng Shao,Yijie Guo,Renjing Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>An excellent representation is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL) performance, especially in vision-based reinforcement learning tasks. The quality of the environment representation directly influences the achievement of the learning task. Previous vision-based RL typically uses explicit or implicit ways to represent environments, such as images, points, voxels, and neural radiance fields. However, these representations contain several drawbacks. They cannot either describe complex local geometries or generalize well to unseen scenes, or require precise foreground masks. Moreover, these implicit neural representations are akin to a ``black box", significantly hindering interpretability. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with its explicit scene representation and differentiable rendering nature, is considered a revolutionary change for reconstruction and representation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Generalizable Gaussian Splatting framework to be the representation of RL tasks, called GSRL. Through validation in the RoboMimic environment, our method achieves better results than other baselines in multiple tasks, improving the performance by 10%, 44%, and 15% compared with baselines on the hardest task. This work is the first attempt to leverage generalizable 3DGS as a representation for RL.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07950](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07950) |
| 382 | A General Framework to Boost 3D GS Initialization for Text-to-3D Generation by Lexical Richness | Lutao Jiang,Hangyu Li,Lin Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Text-to-3D content creation has recently received much attention, especially with the prevalence of 3D Gaussians Splatting. In general, GS-based methods comprise two key stages: initialization and rendering optimization. To achieve initialization, existing works directly apply random sphere initialization or 3D diffusion models, e.g., Point-E, to derive the initial shapes. However, such strategies suffer from two critical yet challenging problems: 1) the final shapes are still similar to the initial ones even after training; 2) shapes can be produced only from simple texts, e.g., "a dog", not for lexically richer texts, e.g., "a dog is sitting on the top of the airplane". To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel general framework to boost the 3D GS Initialization for text-to-3D generation upon the lexical richness. Our key idea is to aggregate 3D Gaussians into spatially uniform voxels to represent complex shapes while enabling the spatial interaction among the 3D Gaussians and semantic interaction between Gaussians and texts. Specifically, we first construct a voxelized representation, where each voxel holds a 3D Gaussian with its position, scale, and rotation fixed while setting opacity as the sole factor to determine a position's occupancy. We then design an initialization network mainly consisting of two novel components: 1) Global Information Perception (GIP) block and 2) Gaussians-Text Fusion (GTF) block. Such a design enables each 3D Gaussian to assimilate the spatial information from other areas and semantic information from texts. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our framework of high-quality 3D GS initialization against the existing methods, e.g., Shap-E, by taking lexically simple, medium, and hard texts. Also, our framework can be seamlessly plugged into SoTA training frameworks, e.g., LucidDreamer, for semantically consistent text-to-3D generation.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01269](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01269) |

Our framework enables robust egocentric and exocentric robot teleoperation in immersive VR, with the 3DGS effectively extending spatial information of a depth sensor with limited FoV and balancing the trade-off between data streaming costs and data visual quality. We evaluated our framework through a user study with 24 participants, which revealed that Reality Fusion leads to significantly better user performance, situation awareness, and user preferences. To support further research and development, we provide an open-source implementation with an easy-to-replicate custom-made telepresence robot, a high-performance virtual reality 3DGS renderer, and an immersive robot control package.

| 380 | LoopSparseGS: Loop Based Sparse-View Friendly Gaussian Splatting | Zhenyu Bao,Guibiao Liao,Kaichen Zhou,Kanglin Liu,Qing Li,Guoping Qiu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Despite the photorealistic novel view synthesis (NVS) performance achieved by the original 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), its rendering quality significantly degrades with sparse input views. This performance drop is mainly caused by the limited number of initial points generated from the sparse input, insufficient supervision during the training process, and inadequate regularization of the oversized Gaussian ellipsoids. To handle these issues, we propose the LoopSparseGS, a loop-based 3DGS framework for the sparse novel view synthesis task. In specific, we propose a loop-based Progressive Gaussian Initialization (PGI) strategy that could iteratively densify the initialized point cloud using the rendered pseudo images during the training process. Then, the sparse and reliable depth from the Structure from Motion, and the window-based dense monocular depth are leveraged to provide precise geometric supervision via the proposed Depth-alignment Regularization (DAR). Additionally, we introduce a novel Sparse-friendly Sampling (SFS) strategy to handle oversized Gaussian ellipsoids leading to large pixel errors. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that LoopSparseGS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for sparse-input novel view synthesis, across indoor, outdoor, and object-level scenes with various image resolutions.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00254](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00254) |
| 379 | Localized Gaussian Splatting Editing with Contextual Awareness | Hanyuan Xiao,Yingshu Chen,Huajian Huang,Haolin Xiong,Jing Yang,Pratusha Prasad,Yajie Zhao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent text-guided generation of individual 3D object has achieved great success using diffusion priors. However, these methods are not suitable for object insertion and replacement tasks as they do not consider the background, leading to illumination mismatches within the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce an illumination-aware 3D scene editing pipeline for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. Our key observation is that inpainting by the state-of-the-art conditional 2D diffusion model is consistent with background in lighting. To leverage the prior knowledge from the well-trained diffusion models for 3D object generation, our approach employs a coarse-to-fine objection optimization pipeline with inpainted views. In the first coarse step, we achieve image-to-3D lifting given an ideal inpainted view. The process employs 3D-aware diffusion prior from a view-conditioned diffusion model, which preserves illumination present in the conditioning image. To acquire an ideal inpainted image, we introduce an Anchor View Proposal (AVP) algorithm to find a single view that best represents the scene illumination in target region. In the second Texture Enhancement step, we introduce a novel Depth-guided Inpainting Score Distillation Sampling (DI-SDS), which enhances geometry and texture details with the inpainting diffusion prior, beyond the scope of the 3D-aware diffusion prior knowledge in the first coarse step. DI-SDS not only provides fine-grained texture enhancement, but also urges optimization to respect scene lighting. Our approach efficiently achieves local editing with global illumination consistency without explicitly modeling light transport. We demonstrate robustness of our method by evaluating editing in real scenes containing explicit highlight and shadows, and compare against the state-of-the-art text-to-3D editing methods.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00083](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00083) |
| 378 | Expressive Whole-Body 3D Gaussian Avatar | Gyeongsik Moon,Takaaki Shiratori,Shunsuke Saito | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Facial expression and hand motions are necessary to express our emotions and interact with the world. Nevertheless, most of the 3D human avatars modeled from a casually captured video only support body motions without facial expressions and hand motions.In this work, we present ExAvatar, an expressive whole-body 3D human avatar learned from a short monocular video. We design ExAvatar as a combination of the whole-body parametric mesh model (SMPL-X) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The main challenges are 1) a limited diversity of facial expressions and poses in the video and 2) the absence of 3D observations, such as 3D scans and RGBD images. The limited diversity in the video makes animations with novel facial expressions and poses non-trivial. In addition, the absence of 3D observations could cause significant ambiguity in human parts that are not observed in the video, which can result in noticeable artifacts under novel motions. To address them, we introduce our hybrid representation of the mesh and 3D Gaussians. Our hybrid representation treats each 3D Gaussian as a vertex on the surface with pre-defined connectivity information (i.e., triangle faces) between them following the mesh topology of SMPL-X. It makes our ExAvatar animatable with novel facial expressions by driven by the facial expression space of SMPL-X. In addition, by using connectivity-based regularizers, we significantly reduce artifacts in novel facial expressions and poses.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21686](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21686) |

Existing methods for generalizable 3D reconstruction either do not scale to large scenes and resolutions, or are limited to interpolation of close input views. latentSplat combines the strengths of regression-based and generative approaches while being trained purely on readily available real video data. The core of our method are variational 3D Gaussians, a representation that efficiently encodes varying uncertainty within a latent space consisting of 3D feature Gaussians. From these Gaussians, specific instances can be sampled and rendered via efficient splatting and a fast, generative decoder. We show that latentSplat outperforms previous works in reconstruction quality and generalization, while being fast and scalable to high-resolution data.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16292](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16292) |

Efros,Xiaolong Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>While neural rendering has led to impressive advances in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, it relies heavily on accurately pre-computed camera poses. To relax this constraint, multiple efforts have been made to train Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) without pre-processed camera poses. However, the implicit representations of NeRFs provide extra challenges to optimize the 3D structure and camera poses at the same time. On the other hand, the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting provides new opportunities given its explicit point cloud representations. This paper leverages both the explicit geometric representation and the continuity of the input video stream to perform novel view synthesis without any SfM preprocessing. We process the input frames in a sequential manner and progressively grow the 3D Gaussians set by taking one input frame at a time, without the need to pre-compute the camera poses.

Although 4D neural reconstruction is popular, registration for such representations remains a challenging task, especially for dynamic scene registration in surgical planning and simulation. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for dynamic surgical neural scene registration. We first utilize 4D Gaussian Splatting to represent the surgical scene and capture both static and dynamic scenes effectively. Then, a spatial aware feature aggregation method, Spatially Weight Cluttering (SWC) is proposed to accurately align the feature between surgical scenes, enabling precise and realistic surgical simulations. Lastly, we present a novel strategy of deformable scene registration to register two dynamic scenes. By incorporating both spatial and temporal information for correspondence matching, our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing registration methods for implicit neural representation.

| 372 | Radiance Fields for Robotic Teleoperation | Maximum Wilder-Smith,Vaishakh Patil,Marco Hutter | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Radiance field methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have revolutionized graphics and novel view synthesis. Their ability to synthesize new viewpoints with photo-realistic quality, as well as capture complex volumetric and specular scenes, makes them an ideal visualization for robotic teleoperation setups. Direct camera teleoperation provides high-fidelity operation at the cost of maneuverability, while reconstruction-based approaches offer controllable scenes with lower fidelity. With this in mind, we propose replacing the traditional reconstruction-visualization components of the robotic teleoperation pipeline with online Radiance Fields, offering highly maneuverable scenes with photorealistic quality. As such, there are three main contributions to state of the art: (1) online training of Radiance Fields using live data from multiple cameras, (2) support for a variety of radiance methods including NeRF and 3DGS, (3) visualization suite for these methods including a virtual reality scene. To enable seamless integration with existing setups, these components were tested with multiple robots in multiple configurations and were displayed using traditional tools as well as the VR headset. The results across methods and robots were compared quantitatively to a baseline of mesh reconstruction, and a user study was conducted to compare the different visualization methods.

| 371 | Trimming the Fat: Efficient Compression of 3D Gaussian Splats through Pruning | Muhammad Salman Ali,Maryam Qamar,Sung-Ho Bae,Enzo Tartaglione | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In recent times, the utilization of 3D models has gained traction, owing to the capacity for end-to-end training initially offered by Neural Radiance Fields and more recently by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models. The latter holds a significant advantage by inherently easing rapid convergence during training and offering extensive editability. However, despite rapid advancements, the literature still lives in its infancy regarding the scalability of these models. In this study, we take some initial steps in addressing this gap, showing an approach that enables both the memory and computational scalability of such models. Specifically, we propose "Trimming the fat", a post-hoc gradient-informed iterative pruning technique to eliminate redundant information encoded in the model. Our experimental findings on widely acknowledged benchmarks attest to the effectiveness of our approach, revealing that up to 75% of the Gaussians can be removed while maintaining or even improving upon baseline performance. Our approach achieves around 50$\\times$ compression while preserving performance similar to the baseline model, and is able to speed-up computation up to 600 FPS.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18214](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18214) |

In such a framework, query points near the same camera ray are likely to sample similar features from very close pixels, resulting in ambiguous query features and degraded detection accuracy. To this end, we introduce RayFormer, a camera-ray-inspired query-based 3D object detector that aligns the initialization and feature extraction of object queries with the optical characteristics of cameras. Specifically, RayFormer transforms perspective-view image features into bird's eye view (BEV) via the lift-splat-shoot method and segments the BEV map to sectors based on the camera rays. Object queries are uniformly and sparsely initialized along each camera ray, facilitating the projection of different queries onto different areas in the image to extract distinct features. Besides, we leverage the instance information of images to supplement the uniformly initialized object queries by further involving additional queries along the ray from 2D object detection boxes. To extract unique object-level features that cater to distinct queries, we design a ray sampling method that suitably organizes the distribution of feature sampling points on both images and bird's eye view. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset to validate our proposed ray-inspired model design. The proposed RayFormer achieves 55.5% mAP and 63.3% NDS, respectively.

| 369 | GOI: Find 3D Gaussians of Interest with an Optimizable Open-vocabulary Semantic-space Hyperplane | Yansong Qu,Shaohui Dai,Xinyang Li,Jianghang Lin,Liujuan Cao,Shengchuan Zhang,Rongrong Ji | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D open-vocabulary scene understanding, crucial for advancing augmented reality and robotic applications, involves interpreting and locating specific regions within a 3D space as directed by natural language instructions. To this end, we introduce GOI, a framework that integrates semantic features from 2D vision-language foundation models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and identifies 3D Gaussians of Interest using an Optimizable Semantic-space Hyperplane. Our approach includes an efficient compression method that utilizes scene priors to condense noisy high-dimensional semantic features into compact low-dimensional vectors, which are subsequently embedded in 3DGS. During the open-vocabulary querying process, we adopt a distinct approach compared to existing methods, which depend on a manually set fixed empirical threshold to select regions based on their semantic feature distance to the query text embedding. This traditional approach often lacks universal accuracy, leading to challenges in precisely identifying specific target areas. Instead, our method treats the feature selection process as a hyperplane division within the feature space, retaining only those features that are highly relevant to the query. We leverage off-the-shelf 2D Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) models to fine-tune the semantic-space hyperplane, enabling a more precise distinction between target regions and others.

| 368 | ScalingGaussian: Enhancing 3D Content Creation with Generative Gaussian Splatting | Shen Chen,Jiale Zhou,Zhongyu Jiang,Tianfang Zhang,Zongkai Wu,Jenq-Neng Hwang,Lei Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The creation of high-quality 3D assets is paramount for applications in digital heritage preservation, entertainment, and robotics. Traditionally, this process necessitates skilled professionals and specialized software for the modeling, texturing, and rendering of 3D objects. However, the rising demand for 3D assets in gaming and virtual reality (VR) has led to the creation of accessible image-to-3D technologies, allowing non-professionals to produce 3D content and decreasing dependence on expert input. Existing methods for 3D content generation struggle to simultaneously achieve detailed textures and strong geometric consistency. We introduce a novel 3D content creation framework, ScalingGaussian, which combines 3D and 2D diffusion models to achieve detailed textures and geometric consistency in generated 3D assets. Initially, a 3D diffusion model generates point clouds, which are then densified through a process of selecting local regions, introducing Gaussian noise, followed by using local density-weighted selection. To refine the 3D gaussians, we utilize a 2D diffusion model with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss, guiding the 3D Gaussians to clone and split. Finally, the 3D Gaussians are converted into meshes, and the surface textures are optimized using Mean Square Error(MSE) and Gradient Profile Prior(GPP) losses. Our method addresses the common issue of sparse point clouds in 3D diffusion, resulting in improved geometric structure and detailed textures. Experiments on image-to-3D tasks demonstrate that our approach efficiently generates high-quality 3D assets.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19035](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19035) |
| 367 | Benchmarking Neural Radiance Fields for Autonomous Robots: An Overview | Yuhang Ming,Xingrui Yang,Weihan Wang,Zheng Chen,Jinglun Feng,Yifan Xing,Guofeng Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for 3D scene representation, offering high-fidelity renderings and reconstructions from a set of sparse and unstructured sensor data. In the context of autonomous robotics, where perception and understanding of the environment are pivotal, NeRF holds immense promise for improving performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey and analysis of the state-of-the-art techniques for utilizing NeRF to enhance the capabilities of autonomous robots. We especially focus on the perception, localization and navigation, and decision-making modules of autonomous robots and delve into tasks crucial for autonomous operation, including 3D reconstruction, segmentation, pose estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), navigation and planning, and interaction. Our survey meticulously benchmarks existing NeRF-based methods, providing insights into their strengths and limitations. Moreover, we explore promising avenues for future research and development in this domain. Notably, we discuss the integration of advanced techniques such as 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), large language models (LLM), and generative AIs, envisioning enhanced reconstruction efficiency, scene understanding, decision-making capabilities. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to leverage NeRFs to empower autonomous robots, paving the way for innovative solutions that can navigate and interact seamlessly in complex environments.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05526](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05526) |
| 366 | Per-Gaussian Embedding-Based Deformation for Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting | Jeongmin Bae,Seoha Kim,Youngsik Yun,Hahyun Lee,Gun Bang,Youngjung Uh | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provides fast and high-quality novel view synthesis, it is a natural extension to deform a canonical 3DGS to multiple frames for representing a dynamic scene. However, previous works fail to accurately reconstruct complex dynamic scenes. We attribute the failure to the design of the deformation field, which is built as a coordinate-based function. This approach is problematic because 3DGS is a mixture of multiple fields centered at the Gaussians, not just a single coordinate-based framework. To resolve this problem, we define the deformation as a function of per-Gaussian embeddings and temporal embeddings. Moreover, we decompose deformations as coarse and fine deformations to model slow and fast movements, respectively. Also, we introduce a local smoothness regularization for per-Gaussian embedding to improve the details in dynamic regions.

| 365 | GaussianSR: High Fidelity 2D Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution | Jintong Hu,Bin Xia,Bin Chen,Wenming Yang,Lei Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Implicit neural representations (INRs) have significantly advanced the field of arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) of images. Most existing INR-based ASSR networks first extract features from the given low-resolution image using an encoder, and then render the super-resolved result via a multi-layer perceptron decoder. Although these approaches have shown promising results, their performance is constrained by the limited representation ability of discrete latent codes in the encoded features. In this paper, we propose a novel ASSR method named GaussianSR that overcomes this limitation through 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). Unlike traditional methods that treat pixels as discrete points, GaussianSR represents each pixel as a continuous Gaussian field. The encoded features are simultaneously refined and upsampled by rendering the mutually stacked Gaussian fields. As a result, long-range dependencies are established to enhance representation ability. In addition, a classifier is developed to dynamically assign Gaussian kernels to all pixels to further improve flexibility. All components of GaussianSR (i.e., encoder, classifier, Gaussian kernels, and decoder) are jointly learned end-to-end. Experiments demonstrate that GaussianSR achieves superior ASSR performance with fewer parameters than existing methods while enjoying interpretable and content-aware feature aggregations.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18046](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18046) |

We present a text-to-3D 360$^{\\circ}$ scene generation pipeline that facilitates the creation of comprehensive 360$^{\\circ}$ scenes for in-the-wild environments in a matter of minutes. Our approach utilizes the generative power of a 2D diffusion model and prompt self-refinement to create a high-quality and globally coherent panoramic image. This image acts as a preliminary "flat" (2D) scene representation. Subsequently, it is lifted into 3D Gaussians, employing splatting techniques to enable real-time exploration. To produce consistent 3D geometry, our pipeline constructs a spatially coherent structure by aligning the 2D monocular depth into a globally optimized point cloud. This point cloud serves as the initial state for the centroids of 3D Gaussians. In order to address invisible issues inherent in single-view inputs, we impose semantic and geometric constraints on both synthesized and input camera views as regularizations. These guide the optimization of Gaussians, aiding in the reconstruction of unseen regions. In summary, our method offers a globally consistent 3D scene within a 360$^{\\circ}$ perspective, providing an enhanced immersive experience over existing techniques.

| 362 | GaussianEditor: Editing 3D Gaussians Delicately with Text Instructions | Junjie Wang,Jiemin Fang,Xiaopeng Zhang,Lingxi Xie,Qi Tian | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, impressive results have been achieved in 3D scene editing with text instructions based on a 2D diffusion model. However, current diffusion models primarily generate images by predicting noise in the latent space, and the editing is usually applied to the whole image, which makes it challenging to perform delicate, especially localized, editing for 3D scenes. Inspired by recent 3D Gaussian splatting, we propose a systematic framework, named GaussianEditor, to edit 3D scenes delicately via 3D Gaussians with text instructions. Benefiting from the explicit property of 3D Gaussians, we design a series of techniques to achieve delicate editing. Specifically, we first extract the region of interest (RoI) corresponding to the text instruction, aligning it to 3D Gaussians. The Gaussian RoI is further used to control the editing process. Our framework can achieve more delicate and precise editing of 3D scenes than previous methods while enjoying much faster training speed, i.e. within 20 minutes on a single V100 GPU, more than twice as fast as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (45 minutes -- 2 hours).</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16037](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16037) |
| 361 | SPLAT: A framework for optimised GPU code-generation for SParse reguLar ATtention | Ahan Gupta,Yueming Yuan,Devansh Jain,Yuhao Ge,David Aponte,Yanqi Zhou,Charith Mendis | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Multi-head-self-attention (MHSA) mechanisms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across natural language processing and vision tasks. However, their quadratic dependence on sequence lengths has bottlenecked inference speeds. To circumvent this bottleneck, researchers have proposed various sparse-MHSA models, where a subset of full attention is computed. Despite their promise, current sparse libraries and compilers do not support high-performance implementations for diverse sparse-MHSA patterns due to the underlying sparse formats they operate on. These formats, which are typically designed for high-performance & scientific computing applications, are either curated for extreme amounts of random sparsity (<1% non-zero values), or specific sparsity patterns. However, the sparsity patterns in sparse-MHSA are moderately sparse (10-50% non-zero values) and varied, resulting in existing sparse-formats trading off generality for performance.  We bridge this gap, achieving both generality and performance, by proposing a novel sparse format: affine-compressed-sparse-row (ACSR) and supporting code-generation scheme, SPLAT, that generates high-performance implementations for diverse sparse-MHSA patterns on GPUs. Core to our proposed format and code generation algorithm is the observation that common sparse-MHSA patterns have uniquely regular geometric properties. These properties, which can be analyzed just-in-time, expose novel optimizations and tiling strategies that SPLAT exploits to generate high-performance implementations for diverse patterns. To demonstrate SPLAT's efficacy, we use it to generate code for various sparse-MHSA models, achieving geomean speedups of 2.05x and 4.05x over hand-written kernels written in triton and TVM respectively on A100 GPUs. Moreover, its interfaces are intuitive and easy to use with existing implementations of MHSA in JAX.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16847](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16847) |
| 360 | HDRSplat: Gaussian Splatting for High Dynamic Range 3D Scene Reconstruction from Raw Images | Shreyas Singh,Aryan Garg,Kaushik Mitra | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The recent advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized the 3D scene reconstruction space enabling high-fidelity novel view synthesis in real-time. However, with the exception of RawNeRF, all prior 3DGS and NeRF-based methods rely on 8-bit tone-mapped Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images for scene reconstruction. Such methods struggle to achieve accurate reconstructions in scenes that require a higher dynamic range. Examples include scenes captured in nighttime or poorly lit indoor spaces having a low signal-to-noise ratio, as well as daylight scenes with shadow regions exhibiting extreme contrast. Our proposed method HDRSplat tailors 3DGS to train directly on 14-bit linear raw images in near darkness which preserves the scenes' full dynamic range and content. Our key contributions are two-fold: Firstly, we propose a linear HDR space-suited loss that effectively extracts scene information from noisy dark regions and nearly saturated bright regions simultaneously, while also handling view-dependent colors without increasing the degree of spherical harmonics. Secondly, through careful rasterization tuning, we implicitly overcome the heavy reliance and sensitivity of 3DGS on point cloud initialization. This is critical for accurate reconstruction in regions of low texture, high depth of field, and low illumination. HDRSplat is the fastest method to date that does 14-bit (HDR) 3D scene reconstruction in $\\le$15 minutes/scene ($\\sim$30x faster than prior state-of-the-art RawNeRF). It also boasts the fastest inference speed at $\\ge$120fps. We further demonstrate the applicability of our HDR scene reconstruction by showcasing various applications like synthetic defocus, dense depth map extraction, and post-capture control of exposure, tone-mapping and view-point.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16503](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16503) |
| 359 | FlowMap: High-Quality Camera Poses, Intrinsics, and Depth via Gradient Descent | Cameron Smith,David Charatan,Ayush Tewari,Vincent Sitzmann | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper introduces FlowMap, an end-to-end differentiable method that solves for precise camera poses, camera intrinsics, and per-frame dense depth of a video sequence. Our method performs per-video gradient-descent minimization of a simple least-squares objective that compares the optical flow induced by depth, intrinsics, and poses against correspondences obtained via off-the-shelf optical flow and point tracking. Alongside the use of point tracks to encourage long-term geometric consistency, we introduce differentiable re-parameterizations of depth, intrinsics, and pose that are amenable to first-order optimization. We empirically show that camera parameters and dense depth recovered by our method enable photo-realistic novel view synthesis on 360-degree trajectories using Gaussian Splatting. Our method not only far outperforms prior gradient-descent based bundle adjustment methods, but surprisingly performs on par with COLMAP, the state-of-the-art SfM method, on the downstream task of 360-degree novel view synthesis (even though our method is purely gradient-descent based, fully differentiable, and presents a complete departure from conventional SfM).</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15259](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15259) |
| 358 | EndoGS: Deformable Endoscopic Tissues Reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting | Lingting Zhu,Zhao Wang,Jiahao Cui,Zhenchao Jin,Guying Lin,Lequan Yu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Surgical 3D reconstruction is a critical area of research in robotic surgery, with recent works adopting variants of dynamic radiance fields to achieve success in 3D reconstruction of deformable tissues from single-viewpoint videos. However, these methods often suffer from time-consuming optimization or inferior quality, limiting their adoption in downstream tasks. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, a recent trending 3D representation, we present EndoGS, applying Gaussian Splatting for deformable endoscopic tissue reconstruction. Specifically, our approach incorporates deformation fields to handle dynamic scenes, depth-guided supervision with spatial-temporal weight masks to optimize 3D targets with tool occlusion from a single viewpoint, and surface-aligned regularization terms to capture the much better geometry. As a result, EndoGS reconstructs and renders high-quality deformable endoscopic tissues from a single-viewpoint video, estimated depth maps, and labeled tool masks. Experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos demonstrate that EndoGS achieves superior rendering quality.

| 357 | Integrating Meshes and 3D Gaussians for Indoor Scene Reconstruction with SAM Mask Guidance | Jiyeop Kim,Jongwoo Lim | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present a novel approach for 3D indoor scene reconstruction that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with mesh representations. We use meshes for the room layout of the indoor scene, such as walls, ceilings, and floors, while employing 3D Gaussians for other objects. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both representations, offering enhanced flexibility and ease of editing. However, joint training of meshes and 3D Gaussians is challenging because it is not clear which primitive should affect which part of the rendered image. Objects close to the room layout often struggle during training, particularly when the room layout is textureless, which can lead to incorrect optimizations and unnecessary 3D Gaussians. To overcome these challenges, we employ Segment Anything Model (SAM) to guide the selection of primitives. The SAM mask loss enforces each instance to be represented by either Gaussians or meshes, ensuring clear separation and stable training. Furthermore, we introduce an additional densification stage without resetting the opacity after the standard densification. This stage mitigates the degradation of image quality caused by a limited number of 3D Gaussians after the standard densification.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16173](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16173) |

Leveraging the coherence of the Gaussian Splatting and Position-Based Dynamics (PBD) in the underlying representation, we manage rendering, view synthesis, and the dynamics of solids and fluids in a cohesive manner. Similar to GaussianShader, we enhance each Gaussian kernel with an added normal, aligning the kernel's orientation with the surface normal to refine the PBD simulation. This approach effectively eliminates spiky noises that arise from rotational deformation in solids. It also allows us to integrate physically based rendering to augment the dynamic surface reflections on fluids. Consequently, our framework is capable of realistically reproducing surface highlights on dynamic fluids and facilitating interactions between scene objects and fluids from new views.

| 355 | DGE: Direct Gaussian 3D Editing by Consistent Multi-view Editing | Minghao Chen,Iro Laina,Andrea Vedaldi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We consider the problem of editing 3D objects and scenes based on open-ended language instructions. A common approach to this problem is to use a 2D image generator or editor to guide the 3D editing process, obviating the need for 3D data. However, this process is often inefficient due to the need for iterative updates of costly 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields, either through individual view edits or score distillation sampling. A major disadvantage of this approach is the slow convergence caused by aggregating inconsistent information across views, as the guidance from 2D models is not multi-view consistent. We thus introduce the Direct Gaussian Editor (DGE), a method that addresses these issues in two stages. First, we modify a given high-quality image editor like InstructPix2Pix to be multi-view consistent. To do so, we propose a training-free approach that integrates cues from the 3D geometry of the underlying scene. Second, given a multi-view consistent edited sequence of images, we directly and efficiently optimize the 3D representation, which is based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Because it avoids incremental and iterative edits, DGE is significantly more accurate and efficient than existing approaches and offers additional benefits, such as enabling selective editing of parts of the scene.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18929](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18929) |
| 354 | 6DGS: 6D Pose Estimation from a Single Image and a 3D Gaussian Splatting Model | Matteo Bortolon,Theodore Tsesmelis,Stuart James,Fabio Poiesi,Alessio Del Bue | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose 6DGS to estimate the camera pose of a target RGB image given a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model representing the scene. 6DGS avoids the iterative process typical of analysis-by-synthesis methods (e.g. iNeRF) that also require an initialization of the camera pose in order to converge. Instead, our method estimates a 6DoF pose by inverting the 3DGS rendering process. Starting from the object surface, we define a radiant Ellicell that uniformly generates rays departing from each ellipsoid that parameterize the 3DGS model. Each Ellicell ray is associated with the rendering parameters of each ellipsoid, which in turn is used to obtain the best bindings between the target image pixels and the cast rays. These pixel-ray bindings are then ranked to select the best scoring bundle of rays, which their intersection provides the camera center and, in turn, the camera rotation. The proposed solution obviates the necessity of an "a priori" pose for initialization, and it solves 6DoF pose estimation in closed form, without the need for iterations. Moreover, compared to the existing Novel View Synthesis (NVS) baselines for pose estimation, 6DGS can improve the overall average rotational accuracy by 12% and translation accuracy by 22% on real scenes, despite not requiring any initialization pose. At the same time, our method operates near real-time, reaching 15fps on consumer hardware.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15484](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15484) |
| 353 | A Survey on 3D Gaussian Splatting | Guikun Chen,Wenguan Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian splatting (GS) has recently emerged as a transformative technique in the realm of explicit radiance field and computer graphics. This innovative approach, characterized by the utilization of millions of learnable 3D Gaussians, represents a significant departure from mainstream neural radiance field approaches, which predominantly use implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values. 3D GS, with its explicit scene representation and differentiable rendering algorithm, not only promises real-time rendering capability but also introduces unprecedented levels of editability. This positions 3D GS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present paper, we provide the first systematic overview of the recent developments and critical contributions in the domain of 3D GS. We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the emergence of 3D GS, laying the groundwork for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By enabling unprecedented rendering speed, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications, ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility. The survey concludes by identifying current challenges and suggesting potential avenues for future research in this domain.

| 352 | Efficient4D: Fast Dynamic 3D Object Generation from a Single-view Video | Zijie Pan,Zeyu Yang,Xiatian Zhu,Li Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Generating dynamic 3D object from a single-view video is challenging due to the lack of 4D labeled data. An intuitive approach is to extend previous image-to-3D pipelines by transferring off-the-shelf image generation models such as score distillation sampling.However, this approach would be slow and expensive to scale due to the need for back-propagating the information-limited supervision signals through a large pretrained model. To address this, we propose an efficient video-to-4D object generation framework called Efficient4D. It generates high-quality spacetime-consistent images under different camera views, and then uses them as labeled data to directly reconstruct the 4D content through a 4D Gaussian splatting model. Importantly, our method can achieve real-time rendering under continuous camera trajectories. To enable robust reconstruction under sparse views, we introduce inconsistency-aware confidence-weighted loss design, along with a lightly weighted score distillation loss. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos show that Efficient4D offers a remarkable 10-fold increase in speed when compared to prior art alternatives while preserving the quality of novel view synthesis. For example, Efficient4D takes only 10 minutes to model a dynamic object, vs 120 minutes by the previous art model Consistent4D.</details> | January 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08742](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08742) |
| 351 | HoloDreamer: Holistic 3D Panoramic World Generation from Text Descriptions | Haiyang Zhou,Xinhua Cheng,Wangbo Yu,Yonghong Tian,Li Yuan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D scene generation is in high demand across various domains, including virtual reality, gaming, and the film industry. Owing to the powerful generative capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models that provide reliable priors, the creation of 3D scenes using only text prompts has become viable, thereby significantly advancing researches in text-driven 3D scene generation. In order to obtain multiple-view supervision from 2D diffusion models, prevailing methods typically employ the diffusion model to generate an initial local image, followed by iteratively outpainting the local image using diffusion models to gradually generate scenes. Nevertheless, these outpainting-based approaches prone to produce global inconsistent scene generation results without high degree of completeness, restricting their broader applications. To tackle these problems, we introduce HoloDreamer, a framework that first generates high-definition panorama as a holistic initialization of the full 3D scene, then leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to quickly reconstruct the 3D scene, thereby facilitating the creation of view-consistent and fully enclosed 3D scenes. Specifically, we propose Stylized Equirectangular Panorama Generation, a pipeline that combines multiple diffusion models to enable stylized and detailed equirectangular panorama generation from complex text prompts. Subsequently, Enhanced Two-Stage Panorama Reconstruction is introduced, conducting a two-stage optimization of 3D-GS to inpaint the missing region and enhance the integrity of the scene. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms prior works in terms of overall visual consistency and harmony as well as reconstruction quality and rendering robustness when generating fully enclosed scenes.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15187](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15187) |
| 350 | Connecting Consistency Distillation to Score Distillation for Text-to-3D Generation | Zongrui Li,Minghui Hu,Qian Zheng,Xudong Jiang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Although recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have significantly improved generation quality, issues like limited level of detail and low fidelity still persist, which requires further improvement. To understand the essence of those issues, we thoroughly analyze current score distillation methods by connecting theories of consistency distillation to score distillation. Based on the insights acquired through analysis, we propose an optimization framework, Guided Consistency Sampling (GCS), integrated with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to alleviate those issues. Additionally, we have observed the persistent oversaturation in the rendered views of generated 3D assets. From experiments, we find that it is caused by unwanted accumulated brightness in 3DGS during optimization. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a Brightness-Equalized Generation (BEG) scheme in 3DGS rendering. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach generates 3D assets with more details and higher fidelity than state-of-the-art methods.

However, the limited availability of comprehensive surgical datasets for training represents a significant challenge in this field. This research introduces a novel method that employs 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate synthetic surgical datasets. We propose a method for extracting and combining 3D Gaussian representations of surgical instruments and background operating environments, transforming and combining them to generate high-fidelity synthetic surgical scenarios. We developed a data recording system capable of acquiring images alongside tool and camera poses in a surgical scene. Using this pose data, we synthetically replicate the scene, thereby enabling direct comparisons of the synthetic image quality (29.592 PSNR). As a further validation, we compared two YOLOv5 models trained on the synthetic and real data, respectively, and assessed their performance in an unseen real-world test dataset. Comparing the performances, we observe an improvement in neural network performance, with the synthetic-trained model outperforming the real-world trained model by 12%, testing both on real-world data.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14846](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14846) |
| 348 | A Benchmark for Gaussian Splatting Compression and Quality Assessment Study | Qi Yang,Kaifa Yang,Yuke Xing,Yiling Xu,Zhu Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>To fill the gap of traditional GS compression method, in this paper, we first propose a simple and effective GS data compression anchor called Graph-based GS Compression (GGSC). GGSC is inspired by graph signal processing theory and uses two branches to compress the primitive center and attributes. We split the whole GS sample via KDTree and clip the high-frequency components after the graph Fourier transform. Followed by quantization, G-PCC and adaptive arithmetic coding are used to compress the primitive center and attribute residual matrix to generate the bitrate file. GGSS is the first work to explore traditional GS compression, with advantages that can reveal the GS distortion characteristics corresponding to typical compression operation, such as high-frequency clipping and quantization. Second, based on GGSC, we create a GS Quality Assessment dataset (GSQA) with 120 samples.

| 347 | GaussianBeV: 3D Gaussian Representation meets Perception Models for BeV Segmentation | Florian Chabot,Nicolas Granger,Guillaume Lapouge | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The Bird's-eye View (BeV) representation is widely used for 3D perception from multi-view camera images. It allows to merge features from different cameras into a common space, providing a unified representation of the 3D scene. The key component is the view transformer, which transforms image views into the BeV. However, actual view transformer methods based on geometry or cross-attention do not provide a sufficiently detailed representation of the scene, as they use a sub-sampling of the 3D space that is non-optimal for modeling the fine structures of the environment. In this paper, we propose GaussianBeV, a novel method for transforming image features to BeV by finely representing the scene using a set of 3D gaussians located and oriented in 3D space. This representation is then splattered to produce the BeV feature map by adapting recent advances in 3D representation rendering based on gaussian splatting. GaussianBeV is the first approach to use this 3D gaussian modeling and 3D scene rendering process online, i.e. without optimizing it on a specific scene and directly integrated into a single stage model for BeV scene understanding. Experiments show that the proposed representation is highly effective and place GaussianBeV as the new state-of-the-art on the BeV semantic segmentation task on the nuScenes dataset.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14108](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14108) |
| 346 | DirectL: Efficient Radiance Fields Rendering for 3D Light Field Displays | Zongyuan Yang,Baolin Liu,Yingde Song,Yongping Xiong,Lan Yi,Zhaohe Zhang,Xunbo Yu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Autostereoscopic display, despite decades of development, has not achieved extensive application, primarily due to the daunting challenge of 3D content creation for non-specialists. The emergence of Radiance Field as an innovative 3D representation has markedly revolutionized the domains of 3D reconstruction and generation. This technology greatly simplifies 3D content creation for common users, broadening the applicability of Light Field Displays (LFDs). However, the combination of these two fields remains largely unexplored. The standard paradigm to create optimal content for parallax-based light field displays demands rendering at least 45 slightly shifted views preferably at high resolution per frame, a substantial hurdle for real-time rendering. We introduce DirectL, a novel rendering paradigm for Radiance Fields on 3D displays. We thoroughly analyze the interweaved mapping of spatial rays to screen subpixels, precisely determine the light rays entering the human eye, and propose subpixel repurposing to significantly reduce the pixel count required for rendering. Tailored for the two predominant radiance fields--Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), we propose corresponding optimized rendering pipelines that directly render the light field images instead of multi-view images. Extensive experiments across various displays and user study demonstrate that DirectL accelerates rendering by up to 40 times compared to the standard paradigm without sacrificing visual quality. Its rendering process-only modification allows seamless integration into subsequent radiance field tasks. Finally, we integrate DirectL into diverse applications, showcasing the stunning visual experiences and the synergy between LFDs and Radiance Fields, which unveils tremendous potential for commercialization applications. \\href{direct-l.github.io}{\\textbf{Project Homepage}</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14053](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14053) |

To accurately localize the Gaussian centers, we build a cost volume representation via plane sweeping, where the cross-view feature similarities stored in the cost volume can provide valuable geometry cues to the estimation of depth. We also learn other Gaussian primitives' parameters jointly with the Gaussian centers while only relying on photometric supervision. We demonstrate the importance of the cost volume representation in learning feed-forward Gaussians via extensive experimental evaluations. On the large-scale RealEstate10K and ACID benchmarks, MVSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance with the fastest feed-forward inference speed (22~fps). More impressively, compared to the latest state-of-the-art method pixelSplat, MVSplat uses $10\\times$ fewer parameters and infers more than $2\\times$ faster while providing higher appearance and geometry quality as well as better cross-dataset generalization.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14627](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14627) |
| 344 | SWinGS: Sliding Windows for Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting | Richard Shaw,Michal Nazarczuk,Jifei Song,Arthur Moreau,Sibi Catley-Chandar,Helisa Dhamo,Eduardo Perez-Pellitero | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis has shown rapid progress recently, with methods capable of producing increasingly photorealistic results. 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a promising method, producing high-quality renderings of scenes and enabling interactive viewing at real-time frame rates. However, it is limited to static scenes. In this work, we extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct dynamic scenes. We model a scene's dynamics using dynamic MLPs, learning deformations from temporally-local canonical representations to per-frame 3D Gaussians. To disentangle static and dynamic regions, tuneable parameters weigh each Gaussian's respective MLP parameters, improving the dynamics modelling of imbalanced scenes. We introduce a sliding window training strategy that partitions the sequence into smaller manageable windows to handle arbitrary length scenes while maintaining high rendering quality. We propose an adaptive sampling strategy to determine appropriate window size hyperparameters based on the scene's motion, balancing training overhead with visual quality. Training a separate dynamic 3D Gaussian model for each sliding window allows the canonical representation to change, enabling the reconstruction of scenes with significant geometric changes. Temporal consistency is enforced using a fine-tuning step with self-supervising consistency loss on randomly sampled novel views. As a result, our method produces high-quality renderings of general dynamic scenes with competitive quantitative performance, which can be viewed in real-time in our dynamic interactive viewer.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13308](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13308) |

Conventional robotic manipulation methods usually learn semantic representation of the observation for action prediction, which ignores the scene-level spatiotemporal dynamics for human goal completion. In this paper, we propose a dynamic Gaussian Splatting method named ManiGaussian for multi-task robotic manipulation, which mines scene dynamics via future scene reconstruction. Specifically, we first formulate the dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that infers the semantics propagation in the Gaussian embedding space, where the semantic representation is leveraged to predict the optimal robot action. Then, we build a Gaussian world model to parameterize the distribution in our dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework, which provides informative supervision in the interactive environment via future scene reconstruction. We evaluate our ManiGaussian on 10 RLBench tasks with 166 variations, and the results demonstrate our framework can outperform the state-of-the-art methods by 13.1\\% in average success rate.

While these methods excel at interpolating {\\em within the training data}, the challenge of generalizing to new scenes and objects from very sparse views persists. Specifically, modeling 3D humans from sparse views presents formidable hurdles due to the inherent complexity of human geometry, resulting in inaccurate reconstructions of geometry and textures. To tackle this challenge, this paper leverages recent advancements in Gaussian Splatting and introduces a new method to learn generalizable human Gaussians that allows photorealistic and accurate view-rendering of a new human subject from a limited set of sparse views in a feed-forward manner. A pivotal innovation of our approach involves reformulating the learning of 3D Gaussian parameters into a regression process defined on the 2D UV space of a human template, which allows leveraging the strong geometry prior and the advantages of 2D convolutions. In addition, a multi-scaffold is proposed to effectively represent the offset details.

| 341 | GS2Mesh: Surface Reconstruction from Gaussian Splatting via Novel Stereo Views | Yaniv Wolf,Amit Bracha,Ron Kimmel | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for accurately representing scenes. However, despite its superior novel view synthesis capabilities, extracting the geometry of the scene directly from the Gaussian properties remains a challenge, as those are optimized based on a photometric loss. While some concurrent models have tried adding geometric constraints during the Gaussian optimization process, they still produce noisy, unrealistic surfaces.  We propose a novel approach for bridging the gap between the noisy 3DGS representation and the smooth 3D mesh representation, by injecting real-world knowledge into the depth extraction process. Instead of extracting the geometry of the scene directly from the Gaussian properties, we instead extract the geometry through a pre-trained stereo-matching model. We render stereo-aligned pairs of images corresponding to the original training poses, feed the pairs into a stereo model to get a depth profile, and finally fuse all of the profiles together to get a single mesh.  The resulting reconstruction is smoother, more accurate and shows more intricate details compared to other methods for surface reconstruction from Gaussian Splatting, while only requiring a small overhead on top of the fairly short 3DGS optimization process.  We performed extensive testing of the proposed method on in-the-wild scenes, obtained using a smartphone, showcasing its superior reconstruction abilities. Additionally, we tested the method on the Tanks and Temples and DTU benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01810](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01810) |

However, its performance on scenes commonly seen in indoor datasets is poor due to the lack of geometric constraints during optimization. We extend 3D Gaussian splatting with depth and normal cues to tackle challenging indoor datasets and showcase techniques for efficient mesh extraction. Specifically, we regularize the optimization procedure with depth information, enforce local smoothness of nearby Gaussians, and use off-the-shelf monocular networks to achieve better alignment with the true scene geometry. We propose an adaptive depth loss based on the gradient of color images, improving depth estimation and novel view synthesis results over various baselines. Our simple yet effective regularization technique enables direct mesh extraction from the Gaussian representation, yielding more physically accurate reconstructions of indoor scenes.

| 339 | GeoGaussian: Geometry-aware Gaussian Splatting for Scene Rendering | Yanyan Li,Chenyu Lyu,Yan Di,Guangyao Zhai,Gim Hee Lee,Federico Tombari | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>During the Gaussian Splatting optimization process, the scene's geometry can gradually deteriorate if its structure is not deliberately preserved, especially in non-textured regions such as walls, ceilings, and furniture surfaces. This degradation significantly affects the rendering quality of novel views that deviate significantly from the viewpoints in the training data. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel approach called GeoGaussian. Based on the smoothly connected areas observed from point clouds, this method introduces a novel pipeline to initialize thin Gaussians aligned with the surfaces, where the characteristic can be transferred to new generations through a carefully designed densification strategy. Finally, the pipeline ensures that the scene's geometry and texture are maintained through constrained optimization processes with explicit geometry constraints. Benefiting from the proposed architecture, the generative ability of 3D Gaussians is enhanced, especially in structured regions.

We present a method that adapts to camera motion and allows high-quality scene reconstruction with handheld video data suffering from motion blur and rolling shutter distortion. Our approach is based on detailed modelling of the physical image formation process and utilizes velocities estimated using visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Camera poses are considered non-static during the exposure time of a single image frame and camera poses are further optimized in the reconstruction process. We formulate a differentiable rendering pipeline that leverages screen space approximation to efficiently incorporate rolling-shutter and motion blur effects into the 3DGS framework. Our results with both synthetic and real data demonstrate superior performance in mitigating camera motion over existing methods, thereby advancing 3DGS in naturalistic settings.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13327](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13327) |

Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approaches for human avatars require per-identity optimization. However, learning a multi-identity representation presents advantages in robustly animating humans under arbitrary poses. We propose to construct a high-order tensor that combines all the learnable 3DGS parameters for all the training identities. By assuming a low-rank structure and factorizing the tensor, we model the complex rigid and non-rigid deformations of multiple subjects in a unified network, significantly reducing the total number of parameters. Our proposed approach leverages information from all the training identities and enables robust animation under challenging unseen poses, outperforming existing approaches. It can also be extended to learn unseen identities.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07284](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07284) |

Traditional methods that remove caustic patterns from images often rely on 2D filtering or pre-training on an annotated dataset, hindering the performance when generalizing to real-world seafloor data with 3D structures. In this paper, we present a novel method Recurrent Gaussian Splatting (RecGS), which takes advantage of today's photorealistic 3D reconstruction technology, 3DGS, to separate caustics from seafloor imagery. With a sequence of images taken by an underwater robot, we build 3DGS recurrently and decompose the caustic with low-pass filtering in each iteration. In the experiments, we analyze and compare with different methods, including joint optimization, 2D filtering, and deep learning approaches. The results show that our method can effectively separate the caustic from the seafloor, improving the visual appearance, and can be potentially applied on more problems with inconsistent illumination.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10318](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10318) |

To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces a novel diffusion-based framework, GVGEN, designed to efficiently generate 3D Gaussian representations from text input. We propose two innovative techniques:(1) Structured Volumetric Representation. We first arrange disorganized 3D Gaussian points as a structured form GaussianVolume. This transformation allows the capture of intricate texture details within a volume composed of a fixed number of Gaussians. To better optimize the representation of these details, we propose a unique pruning and densifying method named the Candidate Pool Strategy, enhancing detail fidelity through selective optimization.

Garcia-Fernandez,Yong Yue,Eng Gee Lim,Xiaohui Zhu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In the rapidly evolving field of 3D reconstruction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) represent significant advancements. Although 2DGS compresses 3D Gaussian primitives into 2D Gaussian surfels to effectively enhance mesh extraction quality, this compression can potentially lead to a decrease in rendering quality. Additionally, unreliable densification processes and the calculation of depth through the accumulation of opacity can compromise the detail of mesh extraction. To address this issue, we introduce MVG-Splatting, a solution guided by Multi-View considerations. Specifically, we integrate an optimized method for calculating normals, which, combined with image gradients, helps rectify inconsistencies in the original depth computations. Additionally, utilizing projection strategies akin to those in Multi-View Stereo (MVS), we propose an adaptive quantile-based method that dynamically determines the level of additional densification guided by depth maps, from coarse to fine detail. Experimental evidence demonstrates that our method not only resolves the issues of rendering quality degradation caused by depth discrepancies but also facilitates direct mesh extraction from dense Gaussian point clouds using the Marching Cubes algorithm. This approach significantly enhances the overall fidelity and accuracy of the 3D reconstruction process, ensuring that both the geometric details and visual quality.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11840](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11840) |
| 332 | Click-Gaussian: Interactive Segmentation to Any 3D Gaussians | Seokhun Choi,Hyeonseop Song,Jaechul Kim,Taehyeong Kim,Hoseok Do | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Interactive segmentation of 3D Gaussians opens a great opportunity for real-time manipulation of 3D scenes thanks to the real-time rendering capability of 3D Gaussian Splatting. However, the current methods suffer from time-consuming post-processing to deal with noisy segmentation output. Also, they struggle to provide detailed segmentation, which is important for fine-grained manipulation of 3D scenes. In this study, we propose Click-Gaussian, which learns distinguishable feature fields of two-level granularity, facilitating segmentation without time-consuming post-processing. We delve into challenges stemming from inconsistently learned feature fields resulting from 2D segmentation obtained independently from a 3D scene. 3D segmentation accuracy deteriorates when 2D segmentation results across the views, primary cues for 3D segmentation, are in conflict. To overcome these issues, we propose Global Feature-guided Learning (GFL). GFL constructs the clusters of global feature candidates from noisy 2D segments across the views, which smooths out noises when training the features of 3D Gaussians. Our method runs in 10 ms per click, 15 to 130 times as fast as the previous methods, while also significantly improving segmentation accuracy.

Casual video captures often suffer from motion blur and varying appearances, which degrade the final quality of coherent 3D visual representation. We propose integrating the physical imaging into the SLAM system, which employs linear HDR radiance maps to collect measurements. Specifically, individual frames aggregate images of multiple poses along the camera trajectory to explain prevalent motion blur in hand-held videos. Additionally, we accommodate per-frame appearance variation by dedicating explicit variables for image formation steps, namely white balance, exposure time, and camera response function. Through joint optimization of additional variables, the SLAM pipeline produces high-quality images with more accurate trajectories.

Jeni | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from 2D images and generating diverse views over time presents a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and temporal dynamics involved. While recent advancements in neural implicit models and dynamic Gaussian Splatting have shown promise, limitations persist, particularly in accurately capturing the underlying geometry of highly dynamic scenes. Some approaches address this by incorporating strong semantic and geometric priors through diffusion models. However, we explore a different avenue by investigating the potential of regularizing the native warp field within the dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework. Our method is grounded on the key intuition that an accurate warp field should produce continuous space-time motions. While enforcing the motion constraints on warp fields is non-trivial, we show that we can exploit knowledge innate to the forward warp field network to derive an analytical velocity field, then time integrate for scene flows to effectively constrain both the 2D motion and 3D positions of the Gaussians. This derived Lucas-Kanade style analytical regularization enables our method to achieve superior performance in reconstructing highly dynamic scenes, even under minimal camera movement, extending the boundaries of what existing dynamic Gaussian Splatting frameworks can achieve.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11309](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11309) |

Doing so instantly from monocular videos offers scalability to broad class of users and wide-scale applications. In this paper, we present a fast, simple, yet effective method for creating animatable 3D digital humans from monocular videos. Our method utilizes the efficiency of Gaussian splatting to model both 3D geometry and appearance. However, we observed that naively optimizing Gaussian splats results in inaccurate geometry, thereby leading to poor animations. This work achieves and illustrates the need of accurate 3D mesh-type modelling of the human body for animatable digitization through Gaussian splats. This is achieved by developing a novel pipeline that benefits from three key aspects: (a) implicit modelling of surface's displacements and the color's spherical harmonics; (b) binding of 3D Gaussians to the respective triangular faces of the body template; (c) a novel technique to render normals followed by their auxiliary supervision. Our exhaustive experiments on three different benchmark datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art results of our method, in limited time settings. In fact, our method is faster by an order of magnitude (in terms of training time) than its closest competitor.

The industry often adopts the method involving multi-view stereo and non-rigid alignment. However, this approach is prone to errors and heavily reliant on time-consuming manual processing by artists. To simplify this process, we propose Topo4D, a novel framework for automatic geometry and texture generation, which optimizes densely aligned 4D heads and 8K texture maps directly from calibrated multi-view time-series images. Specifically, we first represent the time-series faces as a set of dynamic 3D Gaussians with fixed topology in which the Gaussian centers are bound to the mesh vertices. Afterward, we perform alternative geometry and texture optimization frame-by-frame for high-quality geometry and texture learning while maintaining temporal topology stability. Finally, we can extract dynamic facial meshes in regular wiring arrangement and high-fidelity textures with pore-level details from the learned Gaussians.

| 325 | Scaling 3D Reasoning with LMMs to Large Robot Mission Environments Using Datagraphs | W. J. Meijer,A. C. Kemmeren,E. H. J. Riemens,J. E. Fransman,M. van Bekkum,G. J. Burghouts,J. D. van Mil | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper addresses the challenge of scaling Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to expansive 3D environments. Solving this open problem is especially relevant for robot deployment in many first-responder scenarios, such as search-and-rescue missions that cover vast spaces. The use of LMMs in these settings is currently hampered by the strict context windows that limit the LMM's input size. We therefore introduce a novel approach that utilizes a datagraph structure, which allows the LMM to iteratively query smaller sections of a large environment. Using the datagraph in conjunction with graph traversal algorithms, we can prioritize the most relevant locations to the query, thereby improving the scalability of 3D scene language tasks. We illustrate the datagraph using 3D scenes, but these can be easily substituted by other dense modalities that represent the environment, such as pointclouds or Gaussian splats. We demonstrate the potential to use the datagraph for two 3D scene language task use cases, in a search-and-rescue mission example.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10743](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10743) |
| 324 | Interactive Rendering of Relightable and Animatable Gaussian Avatars | Youyi Zhan,Tianjia Shao,He Wang,Yin Yang,Kun Zhou | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Creating relightable and animatable avatars from multi-view or monocular videos is a challenging task for digital human creation and virtual reality applications. Previous methods rely on neural radiance fields or ray tracing, resulting in slow training and rendering processes. By utilizing Gaussian Splatting, we propose a simple and efficient method to decouple body materials and lighting from sparse-view or monocular avatar videos, so that the avatar can be rendered simultaneously under novel viewpoints, poses, and lightings at interactive frame rates (6.9 fps). Specifically, we first obtain the canonical body mesh using a signed distance function and assign attributes to each mesh vertex. The Gaussians in the canonical space then interpolate from nearby body mesh vertices to obtain the attributes. We subsequently deform the Gaussians to the posed space using forward skinning, and combine the learnable environment light with the Gaussian attributes for shading computation. To achieve fast shadow modeling, we rasterize the posed body mesh from dense viewpoints to obtain the visibility. Our approach is not only simple but also fast enough to allow interactive rendering of avatar animation under environmental light changes. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous works, our method can render higher quality results at a faster speed on both synthetic and real datasets.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10707](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10707) |
| 323 | 4D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Dynamic Scene Rendering | Guanjun Wu,Taoran Yi,Jiemin Fang,Lingxi Xie,Xiaopeng Zhang,Wei Wei,Wenyu Liu,Qi Tian,Xinggang Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Representing and rendering dynamic scenes has been an important but challenging task. Especially, to accurately model complex motions, high efficiency is usually hard to guarantee. To achieve real-time dynamic scene rendering while also enjoying high training and storage efficiency, we propose 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) as a holistic representation for dynamic scenes rather than applying 3D-GS for each individual frame. In 4D-GS, a novel explicit representation containing both 3D Gaussians and 4D neural voxels is proposed. A decomposed neural voxel encoding algorithm inspired by HexPlane is proposed to efficiently build Gaussian features from 4D neural voxels and then a lightweight MLP is applied to predict Gaussian deformations at novel timestamps. Our 4D-GS method achieves real-time rendering under high resolutions, 82 FPS at an 800$\\times$800 resolution on an RTX 3090 GPU while maintaining comparable or better quality than previous state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, 1) we leverage MVS to encode geometry-aware Gaussian representations and decode them into Gaussian parameters. 2) To further enhance performance, we propose a hybrid Gaussian rendering that integrates an efficient volume rendering design for novel view synthesis. 3) To support fast fine-tuning for specific scenes, we introduce a multi-view geometric consistent aggregation strategy to effectively aggregate the point clouds generated by the generalizable model, serving as the initialization for per-scene optimization. Compared with previous generalizable NeRF-based methods, which typically require minutes of fine-tuning and seconds of rendering per image, MVSGaussian achieves real-time rendering with better synthesis quality for each scene. Compared with the vanilla 3D-GS, MVSGaussian achieves better view synthesis with less training computational cost. Extensive experiments on DTU, Real Forward-facing, NeRF Synthetic, and Tanks and Temples datasets validate that MVSGaussian attains state-of-the-art performance with convincing generalizability, real-time rendering speed, and fast per-scene optimization.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12218](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12218) |
| 321 | PEGASUS: Physically Enhanced Gaussian Splatting Simulation System for 6DoF Object Pose Dataset Generation | Lukas Meyer,Floris Erich,Yusuke Yoshiyasu,Marc Stamminger,Noriaki Ando,Yukiyasu Domae | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce Physically Enhanced Gaussian Splatting Simulation System (PEGASUS) for 6DOF object pose dataset generation, a versatile dataset generator based on 3D Gaussian Splatting.  Environment and object representations can be easily obtained using commodity cameras to reconstruct with Gaussian Splatting. <i>PEGASUS</i> allows the composition of new scenes by merging the respective underlying Gaussian Splatting point cloud of an environment with one or multiple objects. Leveraging a physics engine enables the simulation of natural object placement within a scene through interaction between meshes extracted for the objects and the environment. Consequently, an extensive amount of new scenes - static or dynamic - can be created by combining different environments and objects. By rendering scenes from various perspectives, diverse data points such as RGB images, depth maps, semantic masks, and 6DoF object poses can be extracted.  Our study demonstrates that training on data generated by PEGASUS enables pose estimation networks to successfully transfer from synthetic data to real-world data. Moreover, we introduce the Ramen dataset, comprising 30 Japanese cup noodle items. This dataset includes spherical scans that captures images from both object hemisphere and the Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, making them compatible with PEGASUS.</details> | January 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02281](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02281) |

We introduce Deceptive-NeRF/3DGS to enhance sparse-view reconstruction with only a limited set of input images, by leveraging a diffusion model pre-trained from multiview datasets. Different from using diffusion priors to regularize representation optimization, our method directly uses diffusion-generated images to train NeRF/3DGS as if they were real input views. Specifically, we propose a deceptive diffusion model turning noisy images rendered from few-view reconstructions into high-quality photorealistic pseudo-observations. To resolve consistency among pseudo-observations and real input views, we develop an uncertainty measure to guide the diffusion model's generation. Our system progressively incorporates diffusion-generated pseudo-observations into the training image sets, ultimately densifying the sparse input observations by 5 to 10 times. Extensive experiments across diverse and challenging datasets validate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and is capable of synthesizing novel views with super-resolution in the few-view setting.</details> | May 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15171](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15171) |
| 319 | GaussCtrl: Multi-View Consistent Text-Driven 3D Gaussian Splatting Editing | Jing Wu,Jia-Wang Bian,Xinghui Li,Guangrun Wang,Ian Reid,Philip Torr,Victor Adrian Prisacariu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose GaussCtrl, a text-driven method to edit a 3D scene reconstructed by the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).  Our method first renders a collection of images by using the 3DGS and edits them by using a pre-trained 2D diffusion model (ControlNet) based on the input prompt, which is then used to optimise the 3D model.  Our key contribution is multi-view consistent editing, which enables editing all images together instead of iteratively editing one image while updating the 3D model as in previous works.  It leads to faster editing as well as higher visual quality.  This is achieved by the two terms:  (a) depth-conditioned editing that enforces geometric consistency across multi-view images by leveraging naturally consistent depth maps.  (b) attention-based latent code alignment that unifies the appearance of edited images by conditioning their editing to several reference views through self and cross-view attention between images' latent representations.  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster editing and better visual results than previous state-of-the-art methods.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08733](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08733) |
| 318 | 3DEgo: 3D Editing on the Go! | Umar Khalid,Hasan Iqbal,Azib Farooq,Jing Hua,Chen Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce 3DEgo to address a novel problem of directly synthesizing photorealistic 3D scenes from monocular videos guided by textual prompts. Conventional methods construct a text-conditioned 3D scene through a three-stage process, involving pose estimation using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) libraries like COLMAP, initializing the 3D model with unedited images, and iteratively updating the dataset with edited images to achieve a 3D scene with text fidelity. Our framework streamlines the conventional multi-stage 3D editing process into a single-stage workflow by overcoming the reliance on COLMAP and eliminating the cost of model initialization. We apply a diffusion model to edit video frames prior to 3D scene creation by incorporating our designed noise blender module for enhancing multi-view editing consistency, a step that does not require additional training or fine-tuning of T2I diffusion models. 3DEgo utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to create 3D scenes from the multi-view consistent edited frames, capitalizing on the inherent temporal continuity and explicit point cloud data. 3DEgo demonstrates remarkable editing precision, speed, and adaptability across a variety of video sources, as validated by extensive evaluations on six datasets, including our own prepared GS25 dataset.

| 317 | Gaussian in the Wild: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Unconstrained Image Collections | Dongbin Zhang,Chuming Wang,Weitao Wang,Peihao Li,Minghan Qin,Haoqian Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis from unconstrained in-the-wild images remains a meaningful but challenging task. The photometric variation and transient occluders in those unconstrained images make it difficult to reconstruct the original scene accurately. Previous approaches tackle the problem by introducing a global appearance feature in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, in the real world, the unique appearance of each tiny point in a scene is determined by its independent intrinsic material attributes and the varying environmental impacts it receives. Inspired by this fact, we propose Gaussian in the wild (GS-W), a method that uses 3D Gaussian points to reconstruct the scene and introduces separated intrinsic and dynamic appearance feature for each point, capturing the unchanged scene appearance along with dynamic variation like illumination and weather. Additionally, an adaptive sampling strategy is presented to allow each Gaussian point to focus on the local and detailed information more effectively. We also reduce the impact of transient occluders using a 2D visibility map. More experiments have demonstrated better reconstruction quality and details of GS-W compared to NeRF-based methods, with a faster rendering speed.

| 316 | SpikeGS: 3D Gaussian Splatting from Spike Streams with High-Speed Camera Motion | Jiyuan Zhang,Kang Chen,Shiyan Chen,Yajing Zheng,Tiejun Huang,Zhaofei Yu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel View Synthesis plays a crucial role by generating new 2D renderings from multi-view images of 3D scenes. However, capturing high-speed scenes with conventional cameras often leads to motion blur, hindering the effectiveness of 3D reconstruction. To address this challenge, high-frame-rate dense 3D reconstruction emerges as a vital technique, enabling detailed and accurate modeling of real-world objects or scenes in various fields, including Virtual Reality or embodied AI. Spike cameras, a novel type of neuromorphic sensor, continuously record scenes with an ultra-high temporal resolution, showing potential for accurate 3D reconstruction. Despite their promise, existing approaches, such as applying Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to spike cameras, encounter challenges due to the time-consuming rendering process. To address this issue, we make the first attempt to introduce the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into spike cameras in high-speed capture, providing 3DGS as dense and continuous clues of views, then constructing SpikeGS. Specifically, to train SpikeGS, we establish computational equations between the rendering process of 3DGS and the processes of instantaneous imaging and exposing-like imaging of the continuous spike stream. Besides, we build a very lightweight but effective mapping process from spikes to instant images to support training. Furthermore, we introduced a new spike-based 3D rendering dataset for validation. Extensive experiments have demonstrated our method possesses the high quality of novel view rendering, proving the tremendous potential of spike cameras in modeling 3D scenes.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10062](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10062) |

Although these methods can successfully synthesize from views similar to training camera trajectory, directing the novel view outside the training camera distribution does not guarantee on-par performance. In this paper, we tackle the Extrapolated View Synthesis (EVS) problem by evaluating the reconstructions on views such as looking left, right or downwards with respect to training camera distributions. To improve rendering quality for EVS, we initialize our model by constructing dense LiDAR map, and propose to leverage prior scene knowledge such as surface normal estimator and large-scale diffusion model. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on EVS. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the EVS problem in urban scene reconstruction.

In this paper, we design a novel tightly coupled LiDAR-Camera Gaussian Splatting (TCLC-GS) to fully leverage the combined strengths of both LiDAR and camera sensors, enabling rapid, high-quality 3D reconstruction and novel view RGB/depth synthesis. TCLC-GS designs a hybrid explicit (colorized 3D mesh) and implicit (hierarchical octree feature) 3D representation derived from LiDAR-camera data, to enrich the properties of 3D Gaussians for splatting. 3D Gaussian's properties are not only initialized in alignment with the 3D mesh which provides more completed 3D shape and color information, but are also endowed with broader contextual information through retrieved octree implicit features. During the Gaussian Splatting optimization process, the 3D mesh offers dense depth information as supervision, which enhances the training process by learning of a robust geometry. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes Dataset validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Utilizing a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti, our method demonstrates fast training and achieves real-time RGB and depth rendering at 90 FPS in resolution of 1920x1280 (Waymo), and 120 FPS in resolution of 1600x900 (nuScenes) in urban scenarios.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02410](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02410) |

Style transfer can enhance these 3D assets with diverse artistic styles, transforming creative expression. However, existing techniques are often slow or unable to localize style transfer to specific objects. We introduce StyleSplat, a lightweight method for stylizing 3D objects in scenes represented by 3D Gaussians from reference style images. Our approach first learns a photorealistic representation of the scene using 3D Gaussian splatting while jointly segmenting individual 3D objects. We then use a nearest-neighbor feature matching loss to finetune the Gaussians of the selected objects, aligning their spherical harmonic coefficients with the style image to ensure consistency and visual appeal. StyleSplat allows for quick, customizable style transfer and localized stylization of multiple objects within a scene, each with a different style. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various 3D scenes and styles, showcasing enhanced control and customization in 3D creation.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09473](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09473) |

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) methods have shown remarkable success in modeling and understanding 3D scenes. Similarly, various 4D representations have demonstrated the ability to capture the dynamics of the 4D world. However, there is a dearth of research focusing on segmentation within 4D representations. In this paper, we propose Segment Any 4D Gaussians (SA4D), one of the first frameworks to segment anything in the 4D digital world based on 4D Gaussians. In SA4D, an efficient temporal identity feature field is introduced to handle Gaussian drifting, with the potential to learn precise identity features from noisy and sparse input. Additionally, a 4D segmentation refinement process is proposed to remove artifacts. Our SA4D achieves precise, high-quality segmentation within seconds in 4D Gaussians and shows the ability to remove, recolor, compose, and render high-quality anything masks.

| 311 | HAC: Hash-grid Assisted Context for 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression | Yihang Chen,Qianyi Wu,Weiyao Lin,Mehrtash Harandi,Jianfei Cai | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising framework for novel view synthesis, boasting rapid rendering speed with high fidelity. However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To address this, we make use of the relations between the unorganized anchors and the structured hash grid, leveraging their mutual information for context modeling, and propose a Hash-grid Assisted Context (HAC) framework for highly compact 3DGS representation. Our approach introduces a binary hash grid to establish continuous spatial consistencies, allowing us to unveil the inherent spatial relations of anchors through a carefully designed context model. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to accurately estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Importantly, our work is the pioneer to explore context-based compression for 3DGS representation, resulting in a remarkable size reduction of over $75\\times$ compared to vanilla 3DGS, while simultaneously improving fidelity, and achieving over $11\\times$ size reduction over SOTA 3DGS compression approach Scaffold-GS.

| 310 | CoR-GS: Sparse-View 3D Gaussian Splatting via Co-Regularization | Jiawei Zhang,Jiahe Li,Xiaohan Yu,Lei Huang,Lin Gu,Jin Zheng,Xiao Bai | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) creates a radiance field consisting of 3D Gaussians to represent a scene. With sparse training views, 3DGS easily suffers from overfitting, negatively impacting rendering. This paper introduces a new co-regularization perspective for improving sparse-view 3DGS. When training two 3D Gaussian radiance fields, we observe that the two radiance fields exhibit point disagreement and rendering disagreement that can unsupervisedly predict reconstruction quality, stemming from the randomness of densification implementation. We further quantify the two disagreements and demonstrate the negative correlation between them and accurate reconstruction, which allows us to identify inaccurate reconstruction without accessing ground-truth information. Based on the study, we propose CoR-GS, which identifies and suppresses inaccurate reconstruction based on the two disagreements: (1) Co-pruning considers Gaussians that exhibit high point disagreement in inaccurate positions and prunes them. (2) Pseudo-view co-regularization considers pixels that exhibit high rendering disagreement are inaccurate and suppress the disagreement. Results on LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and Blender demonstrate that CoR-GS effectively regularizes the scene geometry, reconstructs the compact representations, and achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis quality under sparse training views.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12110](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12110) |
| 309 | Self-Calibrating 4D Novel View Synthesis from Monocular Videos Using Gaussian Splatting | Fang Li,Hao Zhang,Narendra Ahuja | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian Splatting (GS) has significantly elevated scene reconstruction efficiency and novel view synthesis (NVS) accuracy compared to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), particularly for dynamic scenes. However, current 4D NVS methods, whether based on GS or NeRF, primarily rely on camera parameters provided by COLMAP and even utilize sparse point clouds generated by COLMAP for initialization, which lack accuracy as well are time-consuming. This sometimes results in poor dynamic scene representation, especially in scenes with large object movements, or extreme camera conditions e.g. small translations combined with large rotations. Some studies simultaneously optimize the estimation of camera parameters and scenes, supervised by additional information like depth, optical flow, etc. obtained from off-the-shelf models. Using this unverified information as ground truth can reduce robustness and accuracy, which does frequently occur for long monocular videos (with e.g. > hundreds of frames). We propose a novel approach that learns a high-fidelity 4D GS scene representation with self-calibration of camera parameters. It includes the extraction of 2D point features that robustly represent 3D structure, and their use for subsequent joint optimization of camera parameters and 3D structure towards overall 4D scene optimization. We demonstrate the accuracy and time efficiency of our method through extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results on several standard benchmarks. The results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for 4D novel view synthesis.

| 306 | Reference-based Controllable Scene Stylization with Gaussian Splatting | Yiqun Mei,Jiacong Xu,Vishal M. Patel | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Referenced-based scene stylization that edits the appearance based on a content-aligned reference image is an emerging research area. Starting with a pretrained neural radiance field (NeRF), existing methods typically learn a novel appearance that matches the given style. Despite their effectiveness, they inherently suffer from time-consuming volume rendering, and thus are impractical for many real-time applications. In this work, we propose ReGS, which adapts 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reference-based stylization to enable real-time stylized view synthesis. Editing the appearance of a pretrained 3DGS is challenging as it uses discrete Gaussians as 3D representation, which tightly bind appearance with geometry. Simply optimizing the appearance as prior methods do is often insufficient for modeling continuous textures in the given reference image. To address this challenge, we propose a novel texture-guided control mechanism that adaptively adjusts local responsible Gaussians to a new geometric arrangement, serving for desired texture details. The proposed process is guided by texture clues for effective appearance editing, and regularized by scene depth for preserving original geometric structure. With these novel designs, we show ReGs can produce state-of-the-art stylization results that respect the reference texture while embracing real-time rendering speed for free-view navigation.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07220](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07220) |

However, this requirement often hinders their use on low-end devices with limited memory. In response, we propose a groundbreaking paradigm of image representation and compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting, named GaussianImage. We first introduce 2D Gaussian to represent the image, where each Gaussian has 8 parameters including position, covariance and color. Subsequently, we unveil a novel rendering algorithm based on accumulated summation. Remarkably, our method with a minimum of 3$\\times$ lower GPU memory usage and 5$\\times$ faster fitting time not only rivals INRs (e.g., WIRE, I-NGP) in representation performance, but also delivers a faster rendering speed of 1500-2000 FPS regardless of parameter size. Furthermore, we integrate existing vector quantization technique to build an image codec. Experimental results demonstrate that our codec attains rate-distortion performance comparable to compression-based INRs such as COIN and COIN++, while facilitating decoding speeds of approximately 2000 FPS. Additionally, preliminary proof of concept shows that our codec surpasses COIN and COIN++ in performance when using partial bits-back coding.

| 304 | Gaussian Grouping: Segment and Edit Anything in 3D Scenes | Mingqiao Ye,Martin Danelljan,Fisher Yu,Lei Ke | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The recent Gaussian Splatting achieves high-quality and real-time novel-view synthesis of the 3D scenes. However, it is solely concentrated on the appearance and geometry modeling, while lacking in fine-grained object-level scene understanding. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Grouping, which extends Gaussian Splatting to jointly reconstruct and segment anything in open-world 3D scenes. We augment each Gaussian with a compact Identity Encoding, allowing the Gaussians to be grouped according to their object instance or stuff membership in the 3D scene. Instead of resorting to expensive 3D labels, we supervise the Identity Encodings during the differentiable rendering by leveraging the 2D mask predictions by Segment Anything Model (SAM), along with introduced 3D spatial consistency regularization. Compared to the implicit NeRF representation, we show that the discrete and grouped 3D Gaussians can reconstruct, segment and edit anything in 3D with high visual quality, fine granularity and efficiency. Based on Gaussian Grouping, we further propose a local Gaussian Editing scheme, which shows efficacy in versatile scene editing applications, including 3D object removal, inpainting, colorization, style transfer and scene recomposition.

| 303 | PICA: Physics-Integrated Clothed Avatar | Bo Peng,Yunfan Tao,Haoyu Zhan,Yudong Guo,Juyong Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce PICA, a novel representation for high-fidelity animatable clothed human avatars with physics-accurate dynamics, even for loose clothing. Previous neural rendering-based representations of animatable clothed humans typically employ a single model to represent both the clothing and the underlying body. While efficient, these approaches often fail to accurately represent complex garment dynamics, leading to incorrect deformations and noticeable rendering artifacts, especially for sliding or loose garments. Furthermore, previous works represent garment dynamics as pose-dependent deformations and facilitate novel pose animations in a data-driven manner. This often results in outcomes that do not faithfully represent the mechanics of motion and are prone to generating artifacts in out-of-distribution poses. To address these issues, we adopt two individual 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models with different deformation characteristics, modeling the human body and clothing separately. This distinction allows for better handling of their respective motion characteristics. With this representation, we integrate a graph neural network (GNN)-based clothed body physics simulation module to ensure an accurate representation of clothing dynamics. Our method, through its carefully designed features, achieves high-fidelity rendering of clothed human bodies in complex and novel driving poses, significantly outperforming previous methods under the same settings.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05324](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05324) |
| 302 | GaussReg: Fast 3D Registration with Gaussian Splatting | Jiahao Chang,Yinglin Xu,Yihao Li,Yuantao Chen,Xiaoguang Han | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem for large-scale 3D scene scanning and reconstruction. With the help of deep learning, registration methods have evolved significantly, reaching a nearly-mature stage. As the introduction of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), it has become the most popular 3D scene representation as its powerful view synthesis capabilities. Regarding NeRF representation, its registration is also required for large-scale scene reconstruction. However, this topic extremly lacks exploration. This is due to the inherent challenge to model the geometric relationship among two scenes with implicit representations. The existing methods usually convert the implicit representation to explicit representation for further registration. Most recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) is introduced, employing explicit 3D Gaussian. This method significantly enhances rendering speed while maintaining high rendering quality. Given two scenes with explicit GS representations, in this work, we explore the 3D registration task between them. To this end, we propose GaussReg, a novel coarse-to-fine framework, both fast and accurate. The coarse stage follows existing point cloud registration methods and estimates a rough alignment for point clouds from GS. We further newly present an image-guided fine registration approach, which renders images from GS to provide more detailed geometric information for precise alignment. To support comprehensive evaluation, we carefully build a scene-level dataset called ScanNet-GSReg with 1379 scenes obtained from the ScanNet dataset and collect an in-the-wild dataset called GSReg. Experimental results demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. Our GaussReg is 44 times faster than HLoc (SuperPoint as the feature extractor and SuperGlue as the matcher) with comparable accuracy.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05254](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05254) |
| 301 | SurgicalGaussian: Deformable 3D Gaussians for High-Fidelity Surgical Scene Reconstruction | Weixing Xie,Junfeng Yao,Xianpeng Cao,Qiqin Lin,Zerui Tang,Xiao Dong,Xiaohu Guo | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Dynamic reconstruction of deformable tissues in endoscopic video is a key technology for robot-assisted surgery. Recent reconstruction methods based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have achieved remarkable results in the reconstruction of surgical scenes. However, based on implicit representation, NeRFs struggle to capture the intricate details of objects in the scene and cannot achieve real-time rendering. In addition, restricted single view perception and occluded instruments also propose special challenges in surgical scene reconstruction. To address these issues, we develop SurgicalGaussian, a deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting method to model dynamic surgical scenes. Our approach models the spatio-temporal features of soft tissues at each time stamp via a forward-mapping deformation MLP and regularization to constrain local 3D Gaussians to comply with consistent movement. With the depth initialization strategy and tool mask-guided training, our method can remove surgical instruments and reconstruct high-fidelity surgical scenes. Through experiments on various surgical videos, our network outperforms existing method on many aspects, including rendering quality, rendering speed and GPU usage.

GS represents a scene as a set of 3D Gaussians with varying opacities and employs a computationally efficient splatting operation along with analytical derivatives to compute the 3D Gaussian parameters given scene images captured from various viewpoints. Unfortunately, capturing surround view ($360^{\\circ}$ viewpoint) images is impossible or impractical in many real-world imaging scenarios, including underwater imaging, rooms inside a building, and autonomous navigation. In these restricted baseline imaging scenarios, the GS algorithm suffers from a well-known 'missing cone' problem, which results in poor reconstruction along the depth axis. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that using transient data (from sonars) allows us to address the missing cone problem by sampling high-frequency data along the depth axis. We extend the Gaussian splatting algorithms for two commonly used sonars and propose fusion algorithms that simultaneously utilize RGB camera data and sonar data. Through simulations, emulations, and hardware experiments across various imaging scenarios, we show that the proposed fusion algorithms lead to significantly better novel view synthesis (5 dB improvement in PSNR) and 3D geometry reconstruction (60% lower Chamfer distance).</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04687](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04687) |
| 299 | Gaussian Eigen Models for Human Heads | Wojciech Zielonka,Timo Bolkart,Thabo Beeler,Justus Thies | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present personalized Gaussian Eigen Models (GEMs) for human heads, a novel method that compresses dynamic 3D Gaussians into low-dimensional linear spaces. Our approach is inspired by the seminal work of Blanz and Vetter, where a mesh-based 3D morphable model (3DMM) is constructed from registered meshes. Based on dynamic 3D Gaussians, we create a lower-dimensional representation of primitives that applies to most 3DGS head avatars. Specifically, we propose a universal method to distill the appearance of a mesh-controlled UNet Gaussian avatar using an ensemble of linear eigenbasis. We replace heavy CNN-based architectures with a single linear layer improving speed and enabling a range of real-time downstream applications. To create a particular facial expression, one simply needs to perform a dot product between the eigen coefficients and the distilled basis. This efficient method removes the requirement for an input mesh during testing, enhancing simplicity and speed in expression generation. This process is highly efficient and supports real-time rendering on everyday devices, leveraging the effectiveness of standard Gaussian Splatting. In addition, we demonstrate how the GEM can be controlled using a ResNet-based regression architecture. We show and compare self-reenactment and cross-person reenactment to state-of-the-art 3D avatar methods, demonstrating higher quality and better control. A real-time demo showcases the applicability of the GEM representation.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04545](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04545) |
| 298 | TalkingGaussian: Structure-Persistent 3D Talking Head Synthesis via Gaussian Splatting | Jiahe Li,Jiawei Zhang,Xiao Bai,Jin Zheng,Xin Ning,Jun Zhou,Lin Gu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Radiance fields have demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing lifelike 3D talking heads. However, due to the difficulty in fitting steep appearance changes, the prevailing paradigm that presents facial motions by directly modifying point appearance may lead to distortions in dynamic regions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce TalkingGaussian, a deformation-based radiance fields framework for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Leveraging the point-based Gaussian Splatting, facial motions can be represented in our method by applying smooth and continuous deformations to persistent Gaussian primitives, without requiring to learn the difficult appearance change like previous methods. Due to this simplification, precise facial motions can be synthesized while keeping a highly intact facial feature. Under such a deformation paradigm, we further identify a face-mouth motion inconsistency that would affect the learning of detailed speaking motions. To address this conflict, we decompose the model into two branches separately for the face and inside mouth areas, therefore simplifying the learning tasks to help reconstruct more accurate motion and structure of the mouth region. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method renders high-quality lip-synchronized talking head videos, with better facial fidelity and higher efficiency compared with previous methods.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15264](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15264) |
| 297 | CRiM-GS: Continuous Rigid Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting from Motion Blur Images | Junghe Lee,Donghyeong Kim,Dogyoon Lee,Suhwan Cho,Sangyoun Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have received significant attention due to their high-quality novel view rendering ability, prompting research to address various real-world cases. One critical challenge is the camera motion blur caused by camera movement during exposure time, which prevents accurate 3D scene reconstruction. In this study, we propose continuous rigid motion-aware gaussian splatting (CRiM-GS) to reconstruct accurate 3D scene from blurry images with real-time rendering speed. Considering the actual camera motion blurring process, which consists of complex motion patterns, we predict the continuous movement of the camera based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, we leverage rigid body transformations to model the camera motion with proper regularization, preserving the shape and size of the object. Furthermore, we introduce a continuous deformable 3D transformation in the \\textit{SE(3)} field to adapt the rigid body transformation to real-world problems by ensuring a higher degree of freedom. By revisiting fundamental camera theory and employing advanced neural network training techniques, we achieve accurate modeling of continuous camera trajectories. We conduct extensive experiments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on benchmark datasets.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03923](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03923) |
| 296 | A Compact Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation for Real-Time Dynamic View Synthesis | Kai Katsumata,Duc Minh Vo,Hideki Nakayama | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown remarkable success in synthesizing novel views given multiple views of a static scene. Yet, 3DGS faces challenges when applied to dynamic scenes because 3D Gaussian parameters need to be updated per timestep, requiring a large amount of memory and at least a dozen observations per timestep. To address these limitations, we present a compact dynamic 3D Gaussian representation that models positions and rotations as functions of time with a few parameter approximations while keeping other properties of 3DGS including scale, color and opacity invariant. Our method can dramatically reduce memory usage and relax a strict multi-view assumption. In our experiments on monocular and multi-view scenarios, we show that our method not only matches state-of-the-art methods, often linked with slower rendering speeds, in terms of high rendering quality but also significantly surpasses them by achieving a rendering speed of $118$ frames per second (FPS) at a resolution of 1,352$\\times$1,014 on a single GPU.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12897](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12897) |

Existing learning-based approaches suffer from either hole artifacts, missing details, or expensive computations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to render high-quality images from sparse points. This method first attempts to bridge the 3D Gaussian Splatting and point cloud rendering, which includes several cascaded modules. We first use a regressor to estimate Gaussian properties in a point-wise manner, the estimated properties are used to rasterize neural feature descriptors into 2D planes which are extracted from a multiscale extractor. The projected feature volume is gradually decoded toward the final prediction via a multiscale and progressive decoder. The whole pipeline experiences a two-stage training and is driven by our well-designed progressive and multiscale reconstruction loss. Experiments on different benchmarks show the superiority of our method in terms of rendering qualities and the necessities of our main components.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03857](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03857) |

We propose AutoSplat, a framework employing Gaussian splatting to achieve highly realistic reconstructions of autonomous driving scenes. By imposing geometric constraints on Gaussians representing the road and sky regions, our method enables multi-view consistent simulation of challenging scenarios including lane changes. Leveraging 3D templates, we introduce a reflected Gaussian consistency constraint to supervise both the visible and unseen side of foreground objects. Moreover, to model the dynamic appearance of foreground objects, we estimate residual spherical harmonics for each foreground Gaussian. Extensive experiments on Pandaset and KITTI demonstrate that AutoSplat outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis across diverse driving scenarios.

| 293 | Lift, Splat, Map: Lifting Foundation Masks for Label-Free Semantic Scene Completion | Arthur Zhang,Rainier Heijne,Joydeep Biswas | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Autonomous mobile robots deployed in urban environments must be context-aware, i.e., able to distinguish between different semantic entities, and robust to occlusions. Current approaches like semantic scene completion (SSC) require pre-enumerating the set of classes and costly human annotations, while representation learning methods relax these assumptions but are not robust to occlusions and learn representations tailored towards auxiliary tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LSMap, a method that lifts masks from visual foundation models to predict a continuous, open-set semantic and elevation-aware representation in bird's eye view (BEV) for the entire scene, including regions underneath dynamic entities and in occluded areas. Our model only requires a single RGBD image, does not require human labels, and operates in real time. We quantitatively demonstrate our approach outperforms existing models trained from scratch on semantic and elevation scene completion tasks with finetuning. Furthermore, we show that our pre-trained representation outperforms existing visual foundation models at unsupervised semantic scene completion. We evaluate our approach using CODa, a large-scale, real-world urban robot dataset. Supplementary visualizations, code, data, and pre-trained models, will be publicly available soon.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03425](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03425) |
| 292 | Free-SurGS: SfM-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting for Surgical Scene Reconstruction | Jiaxin Guo,Jiangliu Wang,Di Kang,Wenzhen Dong,Wenting Wang,Yun-hui Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Real-time 3D reconstruction of surgical scenes plays a vital role in computer-assisted surgery, holding a promise to enhance surgeons' visibility. Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown great potential for real-time novel view synthesis of general scenes, which relies on accurate poses and point clouds generated by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for initialization. However, 3DGS with SfM fails to recover accurate camera poses and geometry in surgical scenes due to the challenges of minimal textures and photometric inconsistencies. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose the first SfM-free 3DGS-based method for surgical scene reconstruction by jointly optimizing the camera poses and scene representation. Based on the video continuity, the key of our method is to exploit the immediate optical flow priors to guide the projection flow derived from 3D Gaussians. Unlike most previous methods relying on photometric loss only, we formulate the pose estimation problem as minimizing the flow loss between the projection flow and optical flow. A consistency check is further introduced to filter the flow outliers by detecting the rigid and reliable points that satisfy the epipolar geometry. During 3D Gaussian optimization, we randomly sample frames to optimize the scene representations to grow the 3D Gaussian progressively. Experiments on the SCARED dataset demonstrate our superior performance over existing methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation with high efficiency.

| 291 | RTGS: Enabling Real-Time Gaussian Splatting on Mobile Devices Using Efficiency-Guided Pruning and Foveated Rendering | Weikai Lin,Yu Feng,Yuhao Zhu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Point-Based Neural Rendering (PBNR), i.e., the 3D Gaussian Splatting-family algorithms, emerges as a promising class of rendering techniques, which are permeating all aspects of society, driven by a growing demand for real-time, photorealistic rendering in AR/VR and digital twins. Achieving real-time PBNR on mobile devices is challenging.  This paper proposes RTGS, a PBNR system that for the first time delivers real-time neural rendering on mobile devices while maintaining human visual quality. RTGS combines two techniques. First, we present an efficiency-aware pruning technique to optimize rendering speed. Second, we introduce a Foveated Rendering (FR) method for PBNR, leveraging humans' low visual acuity in peripheral regions to relax rendering quality and improve rendering speed.

| 290 | 4D-Rotor Gaussian Splatting: Towards Efficient Novel View Synthesis for Dynamic Scenes | Yuanxing Duan,Fangyin Wei,Qiyu Dai,Yuhang He,Wenzheng Chen,Baoquan Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We consider the problem of novel-view synthesis (NVS) for dynamic scenes. Recent neural approaches have accomplished exceptional NVS results for static 3D scenes, but extensions to 4D time-varying scenes remain non-trivial. Prior efforts often encode dynamics by learning a canonical space plus implicit or explicit deformation fields, which struggle in challenging scenarios like sudden movements or generating high-fidelity renderings. In this paper, we introduce 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DRotorGS), a novel method that represents dynamic scenes with anisotropic 4D XYZT Gaussians, inspired by the success of 3D Gaussian Splatting in static scenes. We model dynamics at each timestamp by temporally slicing the 4D Gaussians, which naturally compose dynamic 3D Gaussians and can be seamlessly projected into images. As an explicit spatial-temporal representation, 4DRotorGS demonstrates powerful capabilities for modeling complicated dynamics and fine details--especially for scenes with abrupt motions. We further implement our temporal slicing and splatting techniques in a highly optimized CUDA acceleration framework, achieving real-time inference rendering speeds of up to 277 FPS on an RTX 3090 GPU and 583 FPS on an RTX 4090 GPU. Rigorous evaluations on scenes with diverse motions showcase the superior efficiency and effectiveness of 4DRotorGS, which consistently outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03307](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03307) |
| 289 | DRAGON: Drone and Ground Gaussian Splatting for 3D Building Reconstruction | Yujin Ham,Mateusz Michalkiewicz,Guha Balakrishnan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D building reconstruction from imaging data is an important task for many applications ranging from urban planning to reconnaissance. Modern Novel View synthesis (NVS) methods like NeRF and Gaussian Splatting offer powerful techniques for developing 3D models from natural 2D imagery in an unsupervised fashion. These algorithms generally require input training views surrounding the scene of interest, which, in the case of large buildings, is typically not available across all camera elevations. In particular, the most readily available camera viewpoints at scale across most buildings are at near-ground (e.g., with mobile phones) and aerial (drones) elevations. However, due to the significant difference in viewpoint between drone and ground image sets, camera registration - a necessary step for NVS algorithms - fails. In this work we propose a method, DRAGON, that can take drone and ground building imagery as input and produce a 3D NVS model. The key insight of DRAGON is that intermediate elevation imagery may be extrapolated by an NVS algorithm itself in an iterative procedure with perceptual regularization, thereby bridging the visual feature gap between the two elevations and enabling registration. We compiled a semi-synthetic dataset of 9 large building scenes using Google Earth Studio, and quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that DRAGON can generate compelling renderings on this dataset compared to baseline strategies.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01761](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01761) |

| 287 | FedRC: A Rapid-Converged Hierarchical Federated Learning Framework in Street Scene Semantic Understanding | Wei-Bin Kou,Qingfeng Lin,Ming Tang,Shuai Wang,Guangxu Zhu,Yik-Chung Wu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as TriSU) is a crucial but complex task for world-wide distributed autonomous driving (AD) vehicles (e.g., Tesla). Its inference model faces poor generalization issue due to inter-city domain-shift. Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) offers a potential solution for improving TriSU model generalization, but suffers from slow convergence rate because of vehicles' surrounding heterogeneity across cities. Going beyond existing HFL works that have deficient capabilities in complex tasks, we propose a rapid-converged heterogeneous HFL framework (FedRC) to address the inter-city data heterogeneity and accelerate HFL model convergence rate. In our proposed FedRC framework, both single RGB image and RGB dataset are modelled as Gaussian distributions in HFL aggregation weight design. This approach not only differentiates each RGB sample instead of typically equalizing them, but also considers both data volume and statistical properties rather than simply taking data quantity into consideration. Extensive experiments on the TriSU task using across-city datasets demonstrate that FedRC converges faster than the state-of-the-art benchmark by 38.7%, 37.5%, 35.5%, and 40.6% in terms of mIoU, mPrecision, mRecall, and mF1, respectively. Furthermore, qualitative evaluations in the CARLA simulation environment confirm that the proposed FedRC framework delivers top-tier performance.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01103](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01103) |

However, this assumption does not hold in real-life settings where obstructions are common, resulting in only partial visibility of the human. Considering this, we present OccFusion, an approach that utilizes efficient 3D Gaussian splatting supervised by pretrained 2D diffusion models for efficient and high-fidelity human rendering. We propose a pipeline consisting of three stages. In the Initialization stage, complete human masks are generated from partial visibility masks. In the Optimization stage, 3D human Gaussians are optimized with additional supervision by Score-Distillation Sampling (SDS) to create a complete geometry of the human. Finally, in the Refinement stage, in-context inpainting is designed to further improve rendering quality on the less observed human body parts.

While rendering such representations is indeed extremely efficient, storing and transmitting them is often prohibitively expensive. To represent large-scale scenes, one often needs to store millions of 3D Gaussians, occupying gigabytes of disk space. This poses a very practical limitation, prohibiting widespread adoption.Several solutions have been proposed to strike a balance between disk size and rendering quality, noticeably reducing the visual quality. In this work, we propose a new representation that dramatically reduces the hard drive footprint while featuring similar or improved quality when compared to the standard 3D Gaussian splats. When compared to other compact solutions, ours offers higher quality renderings with significantly reduced storage, being able to efficiently run on a mobile device in real-time. Our key observation is that nearby points in the scene can share similar representations. Hence, only a small ratio of 3D points needs to be stored. We introduce an approach to identify such points which are called parent points. The discarded points called children points along with attributes can be efficiently predicted by tiny MLPs.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19434](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19434) |
| 282 | On Scaling Up 3D Gaussian Splatting Training | Hexu Zhao,Haoyang Weng,Daohan Lu,Ang Li,Jinyang Li,Aurojit Panda,Saining Xie | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is increasingly popular for 3D reconstruction due to its superior visual quality and rendering speed. However, 3DGS training currently occurs on a single GPU, limiting its ability to handle high-resolution and large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks due to memory constraints. We introduce Grendel, a distributed system designed to partition 3DGS parameters and parallelize computation across multiple GPUs. As each Gaussian affects a small, dynamic subset of rendered pixels, Grendel employs sparse all-to-all communication to transfer the necessary Gaussians to pixel partitions and performs dynamic load balancing. Unlike existing 3DGS systems that train using one camera view image at a time, Grendel supports batched training with multiple views. We explore various optimization hyperparameter scaling strategies and find that a simple sqrt(batch size) scaling rule is highly effective. Evaluations using large-scale, high-resolution scenes show that Grendel enhances rendering quality by scaling up 3DGS parameters across multiple GPUs. On the Rubble dataset, we achieve a test PSNR of 27.28 by distributing 40.4 million Gaussians across 16 GPUs, compared to a PSNR of 26.28 using 11.2 million Gaussians on a single GPU.

To transfer the high rendering quality to generation tasks, a series of research works attempt to generate 3D-Gaussian assets from text. However, the generated assets have not achieved the same quality as those in reconstruction tasks. We observe that Gaussians tend to grow without control as the generation process may cause indeterminacy. Aiming at highly enhancing the generation quality, we propose a novel framework named GaussianDreamerPro. The main idea is to bind Gaussians to reasonable geometry, which evolves over the whole generation process. Along different stages of our framework, both the geometry and appearance can be enriched progressively. The final output asset is constructed with 3D Gaussians bound to mesh, which shows significantly enhanced details and quality compared with previous methods. Notably, the generated asset can also be seamlessly integrated into downstream manipulation pipelines, e.g. animation, composition, and simulation etc., greatly promoting its potential in wide applications.

| 280 | GS-Octree: Octree-based 3D Gaussian Splatting for Robust Object-level 3D Reconstruction Under Strong Lighting | Jiaze Li,Zhengyu Wen,Luo Zhang,Jiangbei Hu,Fei Hou,Zhebin Zhang,Ying He | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The 3D Gaussian Splatting technique has significantly advanced the construction of radiance fields from multi-view images, enabling real-time rendering. While point-based rasterization effectively reduces computational demands for rendering, it often struggles to accurately reconstruct the geometry of the target object, especially under strong lighting. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach that combines octree-based implicit surface representations with Gaussian splatting. Our method consists of four stages. Initially, it reconstructs a signed distance field (SDF) and a radiance field through volume rendering, encoding them in a low-resolution octree. The initial SDF represents the coarse geometry of the target object. Subsequently, it introduces 3D Gaussians as additional degrees of freedom, which are guided by the SDF. In the third stage, the optimized Gaussians further improve the accuracy of the SDF, allowing it to recover finer geometric details compared to the initial SDF obtained in the first stage. Finally, it adopts the refined SDF to further optimize the 3D Gaussians via splatting, eliminating those that contribute little to visual appearance. Experimental results show that our method, which leverages the distribution of 3D Gaussians with SDFs, reconstructs more accurate geometry, particularly in images with specular highlights caused by strong lighting.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18199](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18199) |

Existing methods, however, heavily rely on pre-computed poses and Gaussian initialization by Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms or expensive sensors. For the first time, this paper addresses this issue by integrating self-supervised VO into our pose-free dynamic Gaussian method (VDG) to boost pose and depth initialization and static-dynamic decomposition. Moreover, VDG can work with only RGB image input and construct dynamic scenes at a faster speed and larger scenes compared with the pose-free dynamic view-synthesis method. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach via extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments. Our results show favorable performance over the state-of-the-art dynamic view synthesis methods.

It is currently restricted to frontal teaching scenarios, where even with a powerful GPU and high-speed access to a large storage device where the data set is hosted, interactive demonstrations can hardly be achieved. We present the use of novel view synthesis via compressed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to overcome this restriction, and to even enable students to perform cinematic anatomy on lightweight and mobile devices. Our proposed pipeline first finds a set of camera poses that captures all potentially seen structures in the data. High-quality images are then generated with path tracing and converted into a compact 3DGS representation, consuming < 70 MB even for data sets of multiple GBs. This allows for real-time photorealistic novel view synthesis that recovers structures up to the voxel resolution and is almost indistinguishable from the path-traced images</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11285](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11285) |

With the recent rapid development of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods, it is becoming difficult to keep track of the current state of the art (SoTA) due to methods using different evaluation protocols, codebases being difficult to install and use, and methods not generalizing well to novel 3D scenes. Our experiments support this claim by showing that tiny differences in evaluation protocols of various methods can lead to inconsistent reported metrics. To address these issues, we propose a framework called NerfBaselines, which simplifies the installation of various methods, provides consistent benchmarking tools, and ensures reproducibility. We validate our implementation experimentally by reproducing numbers reported in the original papers. To further improve the accessibility, we release a web platform where commonly used methods are compared on standard benchmarks.

| 276 | Reducing the Memory Footprint of 3D Gaussian Splatting | Panagiotis Papantonakis,Georgios Kopanas,Bernhard Kerbl,Alexandre Lanvin,George Drettakis | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian splatting provides excellent visual quality for novel view synthesis, with fast training and real-time rendering; unfortunately, the memory requirements of this method for storing and transmission are unreasonably high. We first analyze the reasons for this, identifying three main areas where storage can be reduced: the number of 3D Gaussian primitives used to represent a scene, the number of coefficients for the spherical harmonics used to represent directional radiance, and the precision required to store Gaussian primitive attributes. We present a solution to each of these issues. First, we propose an efficient, resolution-aware primitive pruning approach, reducing the primitive count by half. Second, we introduce an adaptive adjustment method to choose the number of coefficients used to represent directional radiance for each Gaussian primitive, and finally a codebook-based quantization method, together with a half-float representation for further memory reduction. Taken together, these three components result in a 27 reduction in overall size on disk on the standard datasets we tested, along with a 1.7 speedup in rendering speed. We demonstrate our method on standard datasets and show how our solution results in significantly reduced download times when using the method on a mobile device.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17074](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17074) |

While real-world datasets are invaluable, simulation-based benchmarks offer a scalable approach for robustness evaluations. However, the creation of a challenging and controllable noisy world with diverse perturbations remains under-explored. To this end, we propose a novel, customizable pipeline for noisy data synthesis, aimed at assessing the resilience of multi-modal SLAM models against various perturbations. The pipeline comprises a comprehensive taxonomy of sensor and motion perturbations for embodied multi-modal (specifically RGB-D) sensing, categorized by their sources and propagation order, allowing for procedural composition. We also provide a toolbox for synthesizing these perturbations, enabling the transformation of clean environments into challenging noisy simulations. Utilizing the pipeline, we instantiate the large-scale Noisy-Replica benchmark, which includes diverse perturbation types, to evaluate the risk tolerance of existing advanced RGB-D SLAM models. Our extensive analysis uncovers the susceptibilities of both neural (NeRF and Gaussian Splatting -based) and non-neural SLAM models to disturbances, despite their demonstrated accuracy in standard benchmarks.

Recent diffusion-based approaches via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) have enabled new possibilities but either intricately couple with human body or struggle to reuse. We introduce ClotheDreamer, a 3D Gaussian-based method for generating wearable, production-ready 3D garment assets from text prompts. We propose a novel representation Disentangled Clothe Gaussian Splatting (DCGS) to enable separate optimization. DCGS represents clothed avatar as one Gaussian model but freezes body Gaussian splats. To enhance quality and completeness, we incorporate bidirectional SDS to supervise clothed avatar and garment RGBD renderings respectively with pose conditions and propose a new pruning strategy for loose clothing. Our approach can also support custom clothing templates as input. Benefiting from our design, the synthetic 3D garment can be easily applied to virtual try-on and support physically accurate animation.

However, its potential for reconstructing detailed 3D shapes has not been fully explored. Existing methods often suffer from limited shape accuracy due to the discrete and unstructured nature of Gaussian splats, which complicates the shape extraction. While recent techniques like 2D GS have attempted to improve shape reconstruction, they often reformulate the Gaussian primitives in ways that reduce both rendering quality and computational efficiency. To address these problems, our work introduces a rasterized approach to render the depth maps and surface normal maps of general 3D Gaussian splats. Our method not only significantly enhances shape reconstruction accuracy but also maintains the computational efficiency intrinsic to Gaussian Splatting. It achieves a Chamfer distance error comparable to NeuraLangelo on the DTU dataset and maintains similar computational efficiency as the original 3D GS methods. Our method is a significant advancement in Gaussian Splatting and can be directly integrated into existing Gaussian Splatting-based methods.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01467](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01467) |
| 272 | PSAvatar: A Point-based Shape Model for Real-Time Head Avatar Animation with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Zhongyuan Zhao,Zhenyu Bao,Qing Li,Guoping Qiu,Kanglin Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Despite much progress, achieving real-time high-fidelity head avatar animation is still difficult and existing methods have to trade-off between speed and quality. 3DMM based methods often fail to model non-facial structures such as eyeglasses and hairstyles, while neural implicit models suffer from deformation inflexibility and rendering inefficiency. Although 3D Gaussian has been demonstrated to possess promising capability for geometry representation and radiance field reconstruction, applying 3D Gaussian in head avatar creation remains a major challenge since it is difficult for 3D Gaussian to model the head shape variations caused by changing poses and expressions. In this paper, we introduce PSAvatar, a novel framework for animatable head avatar creation that utilizes discrete geometric primitive to create a parametric morphable shape model and employs 3D Gaussian for fine detail representation and high fidelity rendering. The parametric morphable shape model is a Point-based Morphable Shape Model (PMSM) which uses points instead of meshes for 3D representation to achieve enhanced representation flexibility. The PMSM first converts the FLAME mesh to points by sampling on the surfaces as well as off the meshes to enable the reconstruction of not only surface-like structures but also complex geometries such as eyeglasses and hairstyles. By aligning these points with the head shape in an analysis-by-synthesis manner, the PMSM makes it possible to utilize 3D Gaussian for fine detail representation and appearance modeling, thus enabling the creation of high-fidelity avatars. We show that PSAvatar can reconstruct high-fidelity head avatars of a variety of subjects and the avatars can be animated in real-time ($\\ge$ 25 fps at a resolution of 512 $\\times$ 512 ).</details> | January 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12900](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12900) |
| 271 | LGS: A Light-weight 4D Gaussian Splatting for Efficient Surgical Scene Reconstruction | Hengyu Liu,Yifan Liu,Chenxin Li,Wuyang Li,Yixuan Yuan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) techniques and their dynamic scene modeling variants, 4D-GS, offers promising prospects for real-time rendering of dynamic surgical scenarios. However, the prerequisite for modeling dynamic scenes by a large number of Gaussian units, the high-dimensional Gaussian attributes and the high-resolution deformation fields, all lead to serve storage issues that hinder real-time rendering in resource-limited surgical equipment. To surmount these limitations, we introduce a Lightweight 4D Gaussian Splatting framework (LGS) that can liberate the efficiency bottlenecks of both rendering and storage for dynamic endoscopic reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the redundancy of Gaussian quantities, we propose Deformation-Aware Pruning by gauging the impact of each Gaussian on deformation. Concurrently, to reduce the redundancy of Gaussian attributes, we simplify the representation of textures and lighting in non-crucial areas by pruning the dimensions of Gaussian attributes. We further resolve the feature field redundancy caused by the high resolution of 4D neural spatiotemporal encoder for modeling dynamic scenes via a 4D feature field condensation. Experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate efficacy of LGS in terms of a compression rate exceeding 9 times while maintaining the pleasing visual quality and real-time rendering efficiency. LGS confirms a substantial step towards its application in robotic surgical services.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16073](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16073) |

It enables us to explore the scaling behavior of 3DGS in terms of primitive numbers and training resolutions that were difficult to explore before and surpass previous state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. We observe a clear positive trend of increasing visual quality when increasing primitive numbers with our method.

To address this gap, we introduce the Hierarchical Graph Human Gaussian Control (HUGS) framework for achieving high-fidelity 3D human reconstruction. Our approach involves leveraging explicitly semantic priors of body parts to ensure the consistency of geometric topology, thereby enabling the capture of the complex geometrical and topological associations among body parts.

It presents notable challenges in achieving realistic clothing deformation. Current methodologies often overlook the influence of motion on surface deformation, resulting in surfaces lacking the constraints imposed by global motion. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative framework, Motion-Based 3D Clo}thed Humans Synthesis (MOSS), which employs kinematic information to achieve motion-aware Gaussian split on the human surface. Our framework consists of two modules: Kinematic Gaussian Locating Splatting (KGAS) and Surface Deformation Detector (UID). KGAS incorporates matrix-Fisher distribution to propagate global motion across the body surface. The density and rotation factors of this distribution explicitly control the Gaussians, thereby enhancing the realism of the reconstructed surface. Additionally, to address local occlusions in single-view, based on KGAS, UID identifies significant surfaces, and geometric reconstruction is performed to compensate for these deformations. Experimental results demonstrate that MOSS achieves state-of-the-art visual quality in 3D clothed human synthesis from monocular videos. Notably, we improve the Human NeRF and the Gaussian Splatting by 33.94% and 16.75% in LPIPS* respectively.

| 267 | Taming 3DGS: High-Quality Radiance Fields with Limited Resources | Saswat Subhajyoti Mallick,Rahul Goel,Bernhard Kerbl,Francisco Vicente Carrasco,Markus Steinberger,Fernando De La Torre | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has transformed novel-view synthesis with its fast, interpretable, and high-fidelity rendering. However, its resource requirements limit its usability. Especially on constrained devices, training performance degrades quickly and often cannot complete due to excessive memory consumption of the model. The method converges with an indefinite number of Gaussians -- many of them redundant -- making rendering unnecessarily slow and preventing its usage in downstream tasks that expect fixed-size inputs. To address these issues, we tackle the challenges of training and rendering 3DGS models on a budget. We use a guided, purely constructive densification process that steers densification toward Gaussians that raise the reconstruction quality. Model size continuously increases in a controlled manner towards an exact budget, using score-based densification of Gaussians with training-time priors that measure their contribution. We further address training speed obstacles: following a careful analysis of 3DGS' original pipeline, we derive faster, numerically equivalent solutions for gradient computation and attribute updates, including an alternative parallelization for efficient backpropagation. We also propose quality-preserving approximations where suitable to reduce training time even further. Taken together, these enhancements yield a robust, scalable solution with reduced training times, lower compute and memory requirements, and high quality. Our evaluation shows that in a budgeted setting, we obtain competitive quality metrics with 3DGS while achieving a 4--5x reduction in both model size and training time. With more generous budgets, our measured quality surpasses theirs. These advances open the door for novel-view synthesis in constrained environments, e.g., mobile devices.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15643](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15643) |

Current works further leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting as 3D representation for improved visual quality and rendering efficiency. However, we observe that existing Gaussian reconstruction models often suffer from multi-view inconsistency and blurred textures. We attribute this to the compromise of multi-view information propagation in favor of adopting powerful yet computationally intensive architectures (e.g., Transformers). To address this issue, we introduce MVGamba, a general and lightweight Gaussian reconstruction model featuring a multi-view Gaussian reconstructor based on the RNN-like State Space Model (SSM). Our Gaussian reconstructor propagates causal context containing multi-view information for cross-view self-refinement while generating a long sequence of Gaussians for fine-detail modeling with linear complexity. With off-the-shelf multi-view diffusion models integrated, MVGamba unifies 3D generation tasks from a single image, sparse images, or text prompts.

This approach relies on the representation power of Gaussian primitives to provide a high-quality rendering. However, primitives optimized at low resolution inevitably exhibit sparsity and texture deficiency, posing a challenge for achieving high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS). To address this problem, we propose Super-Resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting (SRGS) to perform the optimization in a high-resolution (HR) space. The sub-pixel constraint is introduced for the increased viewpoints in HR space, exploiting the sub-pixel cross-view information of the multiple low-resolution (LR) views. The gradient accumulated from more viewpoints will facilitate the densification of primitives. Furthermore, a pre-trained 2D super-resolution model is integrated with the sub-pixel constraint, enabling these dense primitives to learn faithful texture features. In general, our method focuses on densification and texture learning to effectively enhance the representation ability of primitives. Experimentally, our method achieves high rendering quality on HRNVS only with LR inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets such as Mip-NeRF 360 and Tanks & Temples.

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising technique capable of real-time rendering with high-quality 3D reconstruction. This method utilizes 3D Gaussian representation and tile-based splatting techniques, bypassing the expensive neural field querying. Despite its potential, 3DGS encounters challenges, including needle-like artifacts, suboptimal geometries, and inaccurate normals, due to the Gaussians converging into anisotropic Gaussians with one dominant variance. We propose using effective rank analysis to examine the shape statistics of 3D Gaussian primitives, and identify the Gaussians indeed converge into needle-like shapes with the effective rank 1. To address this, we introduce effective rank as a regularization, which constrains the structure of the Gaussians. Our new regularization method enhances normal and geometry reconstruction while reducing needle-like artifacts. The approach can be integrated as an add-on module to other 3DGS variants, improving their quality without compromising visual fidelity.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11672](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11672) |

Neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) have recently emerged as two promising 3D representation techniques based on radiance field rendering, which are able to provide photorealistic rendering results for complex scenes. Therefore, embracing NeRF and 3D-GS in 6G networks is envisioned to be a prominent solution to support emerging 3D applications with enhanced quality of experience. This paper provides a comprehensive overview on the integration of NeRF and 3D-GS in 6G. First, we review the basics of the radiance field rendering techniques, and highlight their applications and implementation challenges over wireless networks. Next, we consider the over-the-air training of NeRF and 3D-GS models over wireless networks by presenting various learning techniques. We particularly focus on the federated learning design over a hierarchical device-edge-cloud architecture, which is suitable for exploiting distributed data and computing resources over 6G networks to train large models representing large-scale scenes. Then, we consider the over-the-air rendering of NeRF and 3D-GS models at wireless network edge. We present three practical rendering architectures, namely local, remote, and co-rendering, respectively, and provide model compression approaches to facilitate the transmission of radiance field models for rendering. We also present rendering acceleration approaches and joint computation and communication designs to enhance the rendering efficiency. In a case study, we propose a new semantic communication enabled 3D content transmission design.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12155](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12155) |
| 259 | A Hierarchical 3D Gaussian Representation for Real-Time Rendering of Very Large Datasets | Bernhard Kerbl,Andr\xc3\xa9as Meuleman,Georgios Kopanas,Michael Wimmer,Alexandre Lanvin,George Drettakis | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis has seen major advances in recent years, with 3D Gaussian splatting offering an excellent level of visual quality, fast training and real-time rendering. However, the resources needed for training and rendering inevitably limit the size of the captured scenes that can be represented with good visual quality. We introduce a hierarchy of 3D Gaussians that preserves visual quality for very large scenes, while offering an efficient Level-of-Detail (LOD) solution for efficient rendering of distant content with effective level selection and smooth transitions between levels.We introduce a divide-and-conquer approach that allows us to train very large scenes in independent chunks. We consolidate the chunks into a hierarchy that can be optimized to further improve visual quality of Gaussians merged into intermediate nodes. Very large captures typically have sparse coverage of the scene, presenting many challenges to the original 3D Gaussian splatting training method; we adapt and regularize training to account for these issues. We present a complete solution, that enables real-time rendering of very large scenes and can adapt to available resources thanks to our LOD method. We show results for captured scenes with up to tens of thousands of images with a simple and affordable rig, covering trajectories of up to several kilometers and lasting up to one hour.

| 258 | Gaussian Splatting Decoder for 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks | Florian Barthel,Arian Beckmann,Wieland Morgenstern,Anna Hilsmann,Peter Eisert | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>NeRF-based 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) like EG3D or GIRAFFE have shown very high rendering quality under large representational variety. However, rendering with Neural Radiance Fields poses challenges for 3D applications: First, the significant computational demands of NeRF rendering preclude its use on low-power devices, such as mobiles and VR/AR headsets. Second, implicit representations based on neural networks are difficult to incorporate into explicit 3D scenes, such as VR environments or video games. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes these limitations by providing an explicit 3D representation that can be rendered efficiently at high frame rates. In this work, we present a novel approach that combines the high rendering quality of NeRF-based 3D-aware GANs with the flexibility and computational advantages of 3DGS. By training a decoder that maps implicit NeRF representations to explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting attributes, we can integrate the representational diversity and quality of 3D GANs into the ecosystem of 3D Gaussian Splatting for the first time. Additionally, our approach allows for a high resolution GAN inversion and real-time GAN editing with 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes.

In this work, we rethink the set of 3D Gaussians as a random sample drawn from an underlying probability distribution describing the physical representation of the scene-in other words, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Under this view, we show that the 3D Gaussian updates can be converted as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) updates by simply introducing noise. We then rewrite the densification and pruning strategies in 3D Gaussian Splatting as simply a deterministic state transition of MCMC samples, removing these heuristics from the framework. To do so, we revise the 'cloning' of Gaussians into a relocalization scheme that approximately preserves sample probability. To encourage efficient use of Gaussians, we introduce a regularizer that promotes the removal of unused Gaussians. On various standard evaluation scenes, we show that our method provides improved rendering quality, easy control over the number of Gaussians, and robustness to initialization.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09591](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09591) |
| 256 | FSGS: Real-Time Few-shot View Synthesis using Gaussian Splatting | Zehao Zhu,Zhiwen Fan,Yifan Jiang,Zhangyang Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis from limited observations remains an important and persistent task. However, high efficiency in existing NeRF-based few-shot view synthesis is often compromised to obtain an accurate 3D representation. To address this challenge, we propose a few-shot view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables real-time and photo-realistic view synthesis with as few as three training views. The proposed method, dubbed FSGS, handles the extremely sparse initialized SfM points with a thoughtfully designed Gaussian Unpooling process. Our method iteratively distributes new Gaussians around the most representative locations, subsequently infilling local details in vacant areas. We also integrate a large-scale pre-trained monocular depth estimator within the Gaussians optimization process, leveraging online augmented views to guide the geometric optimization towards an optimal solution. Starting from sparse points observed from limited input viewpoints, our FSGS can accurately grow into unseen regions, comprehensively covering the scene and boosting the rendering quality of novel views. Overall, FSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and rendering efficiency across diverse datasets, including LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, and Blender.

| 255 | Physically Embodied Gaussian Splatting: A Realtime Correctable World Model for Robotics | Jad Abou-Chakra,Krishan Rana,Feras Dayoub,Niko S\xc3\xbcnderhauf | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>For robots to robustly understand and interact with the physical world, it is highly beneficial to have a comprehensive representation - modelling geometry, physics, and visual observations - that informs perception, planning, and control algorithms. We propose a novel dual Gaussian-Particle representation that models the physical world while (i) enabling predictive simulation of future states and (ii) allowing online correction from visual observations in a dynamic world. Our representation comprises particles that capture the geometrical aspect of objects in the world and can be used alongside a particle-based physics system to anticipate physically plausible future states. Attached to these particles are 3D Gaussians that render images from any viewpoint through a splatting process thus capturing the visual state. By comparing the predicted and observed images, our approach generates visual forces that correct the particle positions while respecting known physical constraints. By integrating predictive physical modelling with continuous visually-derived corrections, our unified representation reasons about the present and future while synchronizing with reality. Our system runs in realtime at 30Hz using only 3 cameras. We validate our approach on 2D and 3D tracking tasks as well as photometric reconstruction quality.

| 254 | Wild-GS: Real-Time Novel View Synthesis from Unconstrained Photo Collections | Jiacong Xu,Yiqun Mei,Vishal M. Patel | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Photographs captured in unstructured tourist environments frequently exhibit variable appearances and transient occlusions, challenging accurate scene reconstruction and inducing artifacts in novel view synthesis. Although prior approaches have integrated the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) with additional learnable modules to handle the dynamic appearances and eliminate transient objects, their extensive training demands and slow rendering speeds limit practical deployments. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising alternative to NeRF, offering superior training and inference efficiency along with better rendering quality. This paper presents Wild-GS, an innovative adaptation of 3DGS optimized for unconstrained photo collections while preserving its efficiency benefits. Wild-GS determines the appearance of each 3D Gaussian by their inherent material attributes, global illumination and camera properties per image, and point-level local variance of reflectance. Unlike previous methods that model reference features in image space, Wild-GS explicitly aligns the pixel appearance features to the corresponding local Gaussians by sampling the triplane extracted from the reference image. This novel design effectively transfers the high-frequency detailed appearance of the reference view to 3D space and significantly expedites the training process. Furthermore, 2D visibility maps and depth regularization are leveraged to mitigate the transient effects and constrain the geometry, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Wild-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering performance and the highest efficiency in both training and inference among all the existing techniques.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10373](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10373) |
| 253 | PUP 3D-GS: Principled Uncertainty Pruning for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Alex Hanson,Allen Tu,Vasu Singla,Mayuka Jayawardhana,Matthias Zwicker,Tom Goldstein | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in novel view synthesis have enabled real-time rendering speeds and high reconstruction accuracy. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), a foundational point-based parametric 3D scene representation, models scenes as large sets of 3D Gaussians. Complex scenes can comprise of millions of Gaussians, amounting to large storage and memory requirements that limit the viability of 3D-GS on devices with limited resources. Current techniques for compressing these pretrained models by pruning Gaussians rely on combining heuristics to determine which ones to remove. In this paper, we propose a principled spatial sensitivity pruning score that outperforms these approaches. It is computed as a second-order approximation of the reconstruction error on the training views with respect to the spatial parameters of each Gaussian. Additionally, we propose a multi-round prune-refine pipeline that can be applied to any pretrained 3D-GS model without changing the training pipeline. After pruning 88.44% of the Gaussians, we observe that our PUP 3D-GS pipeline increases the average rendering speed of 3D-GS by 2.65$\\times$ while retaining more salient foreground information and achieving higher image quality metrics than previous pruning techniques on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10219](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10219) |

Key to our success is a novel dataset of multiview videos containing curated, rendered animated objects from Objaverse. This dataset depicts 44K diverse objects with 110K animations rendered in 48 viewpoints, resulting in 12M videos with a total of 300M frames. We keep our L4GM simple for scalability and build directly on top of LGM, a pretrained 3D Large Reconstruction Model that outputs 3D Gaussian ellipsoids from multiview image input. L4GM outputs a per-frame 3D Gaussian Splatting representation from video frames sampled at a low fps and then upsamples the representation to a higher fps to achieve temporal smoothness. We add temporal self-attention layers to the base LGM to help it learn consistency across time, and utilize a per-timestep multiview rendering loss to train the model. The representation is upsampled to a higher framerate by training an interpolation model which produces intermediate 3D Gaussian representations. We showcase that L4GM that is only trained on synthetic data generalizes extremely well on in-the-wild videos, producing high quality animated 3D assets.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10324](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10324) |
| 251 | GaussianSR: 3D Gaussian Super-Resolution with 2D Diffusion Priors | Xiqian Yu,Hanxin Zhu,Tianyu He,Zhibo Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Achieving high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) from low-resolution input views is a challenging task due to the lack of high-resolution data. Previous methods optimize high-resolution Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) from low-resolution input views but suffer from slow rendering speed. In this work, we base our method on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) due to its capability of producing high-quality images at a faster rendering speed. To alleviate the shortage of data for higher-resolution synthesis, we propose to leverage off-the-shelf 2D diffusion priors by distilling the 2D knowledge into 3D with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). Nevertheless, applying SDS directly to Gaussian-based 3D super-resolution leads to undesirable and redundant 3D Gaussian primitives, due to the randomness brought by generative priors. To mitigate this issue, we introduce two simple yet effective techniques to reduce stochastic disturbances introduced by SDS. Specifically, we 1) shrink the range of diffusion timestep in SDS with an annealing strategy; 2) randomly discard redundant Gaussian primitives during densification. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed GaussainSR can attain high-quality results for HRNVS with only low-resolution inputs on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

| 249 | AV-GS: Learning Material and Geometry Aware Priors for Novel View Acoustic Synthesis | Swapnil Bhosale,Haosen Yang,Diptesh Kanojia,Jiankang Deng,Xiatian Zhu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view acoustic synthesis (NVAS) aims to render binaural audio at any target viewpoint, given a mono audio emitted by a sound source at a 3D scene. Existing methods have proposed NeRF-based implicit models to exploit visual cues as a condition for synthesizing binaural audio. However, in addition to low efficiency originating from heavy NeRF rendering, these methods all have a limited ability of characterizing the entire scene environment such as room geometry, material properties, and the spatial relation between the listener and sound source. To address these issues, we propose a novel Audio-Visual Gaussian Splatting (AV-GS) model. To obtain a material-aware and geometry-aware condition for audio synthesis, we learn an explicit point-based scene representation with an audio-guidance parameter on locally initialized Gaussian points, taking into account the space relation from the listener and sound source. To make the visual scene model audio adaptive, we propose a point densification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the Gaussian points, with the per-point contribution in sound propagation (e.g., more points needed for texture-less wall surfaces as they affect sound path diversion). Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our AV-GS over existing alternatives on the real-world RWAS and simulation-based SoundSpaces datasets.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08920](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08920) |
| 248 | 3D-HGS: 3D Half-Gaussian Splatting | Haolin Li,Jinyang Liu,Mario Sznaier,Octavia Camps | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Photo-realistic 3D Reconstruction is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision. This domain has seen considerable advancements owing to the advent of recent neural rendering techniques. These techniques predominantly aim to focus on learning volumetric representations of 3D scenes and refining these representations via loss functions derived from rendering. Among these, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a significant method, surpassing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). 3D-GS uses parameterized 3D Gaussians for modeling both spatial locations and color information, combined with a tile-based fast rendering technique. Despite its superior rendering performance and speed, the use of 3D Gaussian kernels has inherent limitations in accurately representing discontinuous functions, notably at edges and corners for shape discontinuities, and across varying textures for color discontinuities. To address this problem, we propose to employ 3D Half-Gaussian (3D-HGS) kernels, which can be used as a plug-and-play kernel. Our experiments demonstrate their capability to improve the performance of current 3D-GS related methods and achieve state-of-the-art rendering performance on various datasets without compromising rendering speed.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02720](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02720) |

Our method builds upon the recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that can faithfully reconstruct complex static scenes. Previous attempts to extend 3DGS to represent dynamics have been confined to bounded scenes or require multi-camera captures, and often fail to generalize to unseen motions, limiting their practical application. Our approach overcomes these constraints by leveraging the periodicity of ambient motions to learn the motion trajectory model, coupled with careful regularization. We also propose important practical strategies to improve the visual quality of the baseline 3DGS static reconstructions and to improve memory efficiency critical for GPU-memory intensive learning. We demonstrate high-quality photorealistic novel view synthesis of several ambient natural scenes with intricate textures and fine structural elements.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09395](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09395) |
| 246 | Gaussian Splatting with Localized Points Management | Haosen Yang,Chenhao Zhang,Wenqing Wang,Marco Volino,Adrian Hilton,Li Zhang,Xiatian Zhu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Point management is a critical component in optimizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models, as the point initiation (e.g., via structure from motion) is distributionally inappropriate. Typically, the Adaptive Density Control (ADC) algorithm is applied, leveraging view-averaged gradient magnitude thresholding for point densification, opacity thresholding for pruning, and regular all-points opacity reset. However, we reveal that this strategy is limited in tackling intricate/special image regions (e.g., transparent) as it is unable to identify all the 3D zones that require point densification, and lacking an appropriate mechanism to handle the ill-conditioned points with negative impacts (occlusion due to false high opacity). To address these limitations, we propose a Localized Point Management (LPM) strategy, capable of identifying those error-contributing zones in the highest demand for both point addition and geometry calibration. Zone identification is achieved by leveraging the underlying multiview geometry constraints, with the guidance of image rendering errors. We apply point densification in the identified zone, whilst resetting the opacity of those points residing in front of these regions so that a new opportunity is created to correct ill-conditioned points. Serving as a versatile plugin, LPM can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D Gaussian Splatting models. Experimental evaluation across both static 3D and dynamic 4D scenes validate the efficacy of our LPM strategy in boosting a variety of existing 3DGS models both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, LPM improves both vanilla 3DGS and SpaceTimeGS to achieve state-of-the-art rendering quality while retaining real-time speeds, outperforming on challenging datasets such as Tanks & Temples and the Neural 3D Video Dataset.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04251](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04251) |

When it comes to editing of these objects, however, existing approaches are either slow, compromise on quality, or do not provide enough customization. We introduce a novel approach to quickly edit a 3D model from a single reference view. Our technique first segments the edit image, and then matches semantically corresponding regions across chosen segmented dataset views using DINO features. A color or texture change from a particular region of the edit image can then be applied to other views automatically in a semantically sensible manner. These edited views act as an updated dataset to further train and re-style the 3D scene. The end-result is therefore an edited 3D model. Our framework enables a wide variety of editing tasks such as manual local edits, correspondence based style transfer from any example image, and a combination of different styles from multiple example images. We use Gaussian Splats as our primary 3D representation due to their speed and ease of local editing, but our technique works for other methods such as NeRFs as well. We show through multiple examples that our method produces higher quality results while offering fine-grained control of editing.

Due to its ill-posed nature, recent works leverage powerful prior from 2D diffusion models pretrained on large datasets. Although 2D diffusion models demonstrate strong generalization capability, they cannot provide multi-view shape priors with guaranteed 3D consistency. We propose Human 3Diffusion: Realistic Avatar Creation via Explicit 3D Consistent Diffusion. Our key insight is that 2D multi-view diffusion and 3D reconstruction models provide complementary information for each other, and by coupling them in a tight manner, we can fully leverage the potential of both models. We introduce a novel image-conditioned generative 3D Gaussian Splats reconstruction model that leverages the priors from 2D multi-view diffusion models, and provides an explicit 3D representation, which further guides the 2D reverse sampling process to have better 3D consistency. Experiments show that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods and enables the creation of realistic avatars from a single RGB image, achieving high-fidelity in both geometry and appearance.

| 243 | From Chaos to Clarity: 3DGS in the Dark | Zhihao Li,Yufei Wang,Alex Kot,Bihan Wen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis from raw images provides superior high dynamic range (HDR) information compared to reconstructions from low dynamic range RGB images. However, the inherent noise in unprocessed raw images compromises the accuracy of 3D scene representation. Our study reveals that 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is particularly susceptible to this noise, leading to numerous elongated Gaussian shapes that overfit the noise, thereby significantly degrading reconstruction quality and reducing inference speed, especially in scenarios with limited views. To address these issues, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework designed to reconstruct HDR 3DGS from a limited number of noisy raw images. This framework enhances 3DGS by integrating a noise extractor and employing a noise-robust reconstruction loss that leverages a noise distribution prior.

By encoding the shape and color information within neural network weights, NeRFs excel at producing strikingly sharp novel views of 3D objects. Recently, numerous generalizations of NeRFs utilizing generative models have emerged, expanding its versatility. In contrast, Gaussian Splatting (GS) offers a similar render quality with faster training and inference as it does not need neural networks to work. It encodes information about the 3D objects in the set of Gaussian distributions that can be rendered in 3D similarly to classical meshes. Unfortunately, GS are difficult to condition since they usually require circa hundred thousand Gaussian components. To mitigate the caveats of both models, we propose a hybrid model Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) that uses GS representation of the 3D object's shape and NeRF-based encoding of color and opacity. Our model uses Gaussian distributions with trainable positions (i.e. means of Gaussian), shape (i.e. covariance of Gaussian), color and opacity, and a neural network that takes Gaussian parameters and viewing direction to produce changes in the said color and opacity. As a result, our model better describes shadows, light reflections, and the transparency of 3D objects without adding additional texture and light components.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13729](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13729) |

Previous arts for geometry reconstruction from 3D Gaussians mainly focus on exploring strong geometry regularization. Instead, from a fresh perspective, we propose to obtain accurate 3D geometry of a scene by Gaussian trimming, which selectively removes the inaccurate geometry while preserving accurate structures. To achieve this, we analyze the contributions of individual 3D Gaussians and propose a contribution-based trimming strategy to remove the redundant or inaccurate Gaussians. Furthermore, our experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that a relatively small Gaussian scale is a non-negligible factor in representing and optimizing the intricate details. Therefore the proposed TrimGS maintains relatively small Gaussian scales. In addition, TrimGS is also compatible with the effective geometry regularization strategies in previous arts. When combined with the original 3DGS and the state-of-the-art 2DGS, TrimGS consistently yields more accurate geometry and higher perceptual quality.

| 239 | A Construct-Optimize Approach to Sparse View Synthesis without Camera Pose | Kaiwen Jiang,Yang Fu,Mukund Varma T,Yash Belhe,Xiaolong Wang,Hao Su,Ravi Ramamoorthi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis from a sparse set of input images is a challenging problem of great practical interest, especially when camera poses are absent or inaccurate. Direct optimization of camera poses and usage of estimated depths in neural radiance field algorithms usually do not produce good results because of the coupling between poses and depths, and inaccuracies in monocular depth estimation. In this paper, we leverage the recent 3D Gaussian splatting method to develop a novel construct-and-optimize method for sparse view synthesis without camera poses. Specifically, we construct a solution progressively by using monocular depth and projecting pixels back into the 3D world. During construction, we optimize the solution by detecting 2D correspondences between training views and the corresponding rendered images. We develop a unified differentiable pipeline for camera registration and adjustment of both camera poses and depths, followed by back-projection. We also introduce a novel notion of an expected surface in Gaussian splatting, which is critical to our optimization. These steps enable a coarse solution, which can then be low-pass filtered and refined using standard optimization methods. We demonstrate results on the Tanks and Temples and Static Hikes datasets with as few as three widely-spaced views, showing significantly better quality than competing methods, including those with approximate camera pose information. Moreover, our results improve with more views and outperform previous InstantNGP and Gaussian Splatting algorithms even when using half the dataset.

| 238 | GaussianCity: Generative Gaussian Splatting for Unbounded 3D City Generation | Haozhe Xie,Zhaoxi Chen,Fangzhou Hong,Ziwei Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D city generation with NeRF-based methods shows promising generation results but is computationally inefficient. Recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a highly efficient alternative for object-level 3D generation. However, adapting 3D-GS from finite-scale 3D objects and humans to infinite-scale 3D cities is non-trivial. Unbounded 3D city generation entails significant storage overhead (out-of-memory issues), arising from the need to expand points to billions, often demanding hundreds of Gigabytes of VRAM for a city scene spanning 10km^2. In this paper, we propose GaussianCity, a generative Gaussian Splatting framework dedicated to efficiently synthesizing unbounded 3D cities with a single feed-forward pass. Our key insights are two-fold: 1) Compact 3D Scene Representation: We introduce BEV-Point as a highly compact intermediate representation, ensuring that the growth in VRAM usage for unbounded scenes remains constant, thus enabling unbounded city generation. 2) Spatial-aware Gaussian Attribute Decoder: We present spatial-aware BEV-Point decoder to produce 3D Gaussian attributes, which leverages Point Serializer to integrate the structural and contextual characteristics of BEV points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaussianCity achieves state-of-the-art results in both drone-view and street-view 3D city generation. Notably, compared to CityDreamer, GaussianCity exhibits superior performance with a speedup of 60 times (10.72 FPS v.s. 0.18 FPS).</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06526](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06526) |

However, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds, it is difficult to guarantee geometric reconstruction accuracy and multi-view consistency simply by relying on image reconstruction loss. Although many studies on surface reconstruction based on 3DGS have emerged recently, the quality of their meshes is generally unsatisfactory. To address this problem, we propose a fast planar-based Gaussian splatting reconstruction representation (PGSR) to achieve high-fidelity surface reconstruction while ensuring high-quality rendering. Specifically, we first introduce an unbiased depth rendering method, which directly renders the distance from the camera origin to the Gaussian plane and the corresponding normal map based on the Gaussian distribution of the point cloud, and divides the two to obtain the unbiased depth. We then introduce single-view geometric, multi-view photometric, and geometric regularization to preserve global geometric accuracy. We also propose a camera exposure compensation model to cope with scenes with large illumination variations. Experiments on indoor and outdoor scenes show that our method achieves fast training and rendering while maintaining high-fidelity rendering and geometric reconstruction, outperforming 3DGS-based and NeRF-based methods.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06521](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06521) |
| 236 | DreamGaussian4D: Generative 4D Gaussian Splatting | Jiawei Ren,Liang Pan,Jiaxiang Tang,Chi Zhang,Ang Cao,Gang Zeng,Ziwei Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>4D content generation has achieved remarkable progress recently. However, existing methods suffer from long optimization times, a lack of motion controllability, and a low quality of details. In this paper, we introduce DreamGaussian4D (DG4D), an efficient 4D generation framework that builds on Gaussian Splatting (GS). Our key insight is that combining explicit modeling of spatial transformations with static GS makes an efficient and powerful representation for 4D generation. Moreover, video generation methods have the potential to offer valuable spatial-temporal priors, enhancing the high-quality 4D generation. Specifically, we propose an integral framework with two major modules: 1) Image-to-4D GS - we initially generate static GS with DreamGaussianHD, followed by HexPlane-based dynamic generation with Gaussian deformation; and 2) Video-to-Video Texture Refinement - we refine the generated UV-space texture maps and meanwhile enhance their temporal consistency by utilizing a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model. Notably, DG4D reduces the optimization time from several hours to just a few minutes, allows the generated 3D motion to be visually controlled, and produces animated meshes that can be realistically rendered in 3D engines.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17142](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17142) |
| 235 | Lighting Every Darkness with 3DGS: Fast Training and Real-Time Rendering for HDR View Synthesis | Xin Jin,Pengyi Jiao,Zheng-Peng Duan,Xingchao Yang,Chun-Le Guo,Bo Ren,Chongyi Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Volumetric rendering based methods, like NeRF, excel in HDR view synthesis from RAWimages, especially for nighttime scenes. While, they suffer from long training times and cannot perform real-time rendering due to dense sampling requirements. The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering and faster training. However, implementing RAW image-based view synthesis directly using 3DGS is challenging due to its inherent drawbacks: 1) in nighttime scenes, extremely low SNR leads to poor structure-from-motion (SfM) estimation in distant views; 2) the limited representation capacity of spherical harmonics (SH) function is unsuitable for RAW linear color space; and 3) inaccurate scene structure hampers downstream tasks such as refocusing. To address these issues, we propose LE3D (Lighting Every darkness with 3DGS). Our method proposes Cone Scatter Initialization to enrich the estimation of SfM, and replaces SH with a Color MLP to represent the RAW linear color space. Additionally, we introduce depth distortion and near-far regularizations to improve the accuracy of scene structure for downstream tasks. These designs enable LE3D to perform real-time novel view synthesis, HDR rendering, refocusing, and tone-mapping changes. Compared to previous volumetric rendering based methods, LE3D reduces training time to 1% and improves rendering speed by up to 4,000 times for 2K resolution images in terms of FPS.

Levin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The proliferation of 3D representations, from explicit meshes to implicit neural fields and more, motivates the need for simulators agnostic to representation. We present a data-, mesh-, and grid-free solution for elastic simulation for any object in any geometric representation undergoing large, nonlinear deformations. We note that every standard geometric representation can be reduced to an occupancy function queried at any point in space, and we define a simulator atop this common interface. For each object, we fit a small implicit neural network encoding spatially varying weights that act as a reduced deformation basis. These weights are trained to learn physically significant motions in the object via random perturbations. Our loss ensures we find a weight-space basis that best minimizes deformation energy by stochastically evaluating elastic energies through Monte Carlo sampling of the deformation volume. At runtime, we simulate in the reduced basis and sample the deformations back to the original domain. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility, accuracy, and speed of this approach on data including signed distance functions, point clouds, neural primitives, tomography scans, radiance fields, Gaussian splats, surface meshes, and volume meshes, as well as showing a variety of material energies, contact models, and time integration schemes.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09497](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09497) |
| 233 | RefGaussian: Disentangling Reflections from 3D Gaussian Splatting for Realistic Rendering | Rui Zhang,Tianyue Luo,Weidong Yang,Ben Fei,Jingyi Xu,Qingyuan Zhou,Keyi Liu,Ying He | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has made a notable advancement in the field of neural rendering, 3D scene reconstruction, and novel view synthesis. Nevertheless, 3D-GS encounters the main challenge when it comes to accurately representing physical reflections, especially in the case of total reflection and semi-reflection that are commonly found in real-world scenes. This limitation causes reflections to be mistakenly treated as independent elements with physical presence, leading to imprecise reconstructions. Herein, to tackle this challenge, we propose RefGaussian to disentangle reflections from 3D-GS for realistically modeling reflections. Specifically, we propose to split a scene into transmitted and reflected components and represent these components using two Spherical Harmonics (SH). Given that this decomposition is not fully determined, we employ local regularization techniques to ensure local smoothness for both the transmitted and reflected components, thereby achieving more plausible decomposition outcomes than 3D-GS. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior novel view synthesis and accurate depth estimation outcomes. Furthermore, it enables the utilization of scene editing applications, ensuring both high-quality results and physical coherence.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05852](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05852) |
| 232 | 2D Gaussian Splatting for Geometrically Accurate Radiance Fields | Binbin Huang,Zehao Yu,Anpei Chen,Andreas Geiger,Shenghua Gao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently revolutionized radiance field reconstruction, achieving high quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering speed without baking. However, 3DGS fails to accurately represent surfaces due to the multi-view inconsistent nature of 3D Gaussians. We present 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), a novel approach to model and reconstruct geometrically accurate radiance fields from multi-view images. Our key idea is to collapse the 3D volume into a set of 2D oriented planar Gaussian disks. Unlike 3D Gaussians, 2D Gaussians provide view-consistent geometry while modeling surfaces intrinsically. To accurately recover thin surfaces and achieve stable optimization, we introduce a perspective-correct 2D splatting process utilizing ray-splat intersection and rasterization. Additionally, we incorporate depth distortion and normal consistency terms to further enhance the quality of the reconstructions. We demonstrate that our differentiable renderer allows for noise-free and detailed geometry reconstruction while maintaining competitive appearance quality, fast training speed, and real-time rendering.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17888](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17888) |

Henriques,Christian Rupprecht,Andrea Vedaldi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we propose Flash3D, a method for scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis from a single image which is both very generalisable and efficient. For generalisability, we start from a "foundation" model for monocular depth estimation and extend it to a full 3D shape and appearance reconstructor. For efficiency, we base this extension on feed-forward Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, we predict a first layer of 3D Gaussians at the predicted depth, and then add additional layers of Gaussians that are offset in space, allowing the model to complete the reconstruction behind occlusions and truncations. Flash3D is very efficient, trainable on a single GPU in a day, and thus accessible to most researchers. It achieves state-of-the-art results when trained and tested on RealEstate10k. When transferred to unseen datasets like NYU it outperforms competitors by a large margin. More impressively, when transferred to KITTI, Flash3D achieves better PSNR than methods trained specifically on that dataset. In some instances, it even outperforms recent methods that use multiple views as input.

Wong | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D modeling has long been an important area in computer vision and computer graphics. Recently, thanks to the breakthroughs in neural representations and generative models, we witnessed a rapid development of 3D modeling. 3D human modeling, lying at the core of many real-world applications, such as gaming and animation, has attracted significant attention. Over the past few years, a large body of work on creating 3D human avatars has been introduced, forming a new and abundant knowledge base for 3D human modeling. The scale of the literature makes it difficult for individuals to keep track of all the works. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these emerging techniques for 3D human avatar modeling, from both reconstruction and generation perspectives. Firstly, we review representative methods for 3D human reconstruction, including methods based on pixel-aligned implicit function, neural radiance field, and 3D Gaussian Splatting, etc. We then summarize representative methods for 3D human generation, especially those using large language models like CLIP, diffusion models, and various 3D representations, which demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we discuss our reflection on existing methods and open challenges for 3D human avatar modeling, shedding light on future research.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04253](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04253) |
| 229 | Superpoint Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time High-Fidelity Dynamic Scene Reconstruction | Diwen Wan,Ruijie Lu,Gang Zeng | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Rendering novel view images in dynamic scenes is a crucial yet challenging task. Current methods mainly utilize NeRF-based methods to represent the static scene and an additional time-variant MLP to model scene deformations, resulting in relatively low rendering quality as well as slow inference speed. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Superpoint Gaussian Splatting (SP-GS). Specifically, our framework first employs explicit 3D Gaussians to reconstruct the scene and then clusters Gaussians with similar properties (e.g., rotation, translation, and location) into superpoints. Empowered by these superpoints, our method manages to extend 3D Gaussian splatting to dynamic scenes with only a slight increase in computational expense. Apart from achieving state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering under high resolutions, the superpoint representation provides a stronger manipulation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

| 228 | Enhancing Temporal Consistency in Video Editing by Reconstructing Videos with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Inkyu Shin,Qihang Yu,Xiaohui Shen,In So Kweon,Kuk-Jin Yoon,Liang-Chieh Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in zero-shot video diffusion models have shown promise for text-driven video editing, but challenges remain in achieving high temporal consistency. To address this, we introduce Video-3DGS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based video refiner designed to enhance temporal consistency in zero-shot video editors. Our approach utilizes a two-stage 3D Gaussian optimizing process tailored for editing dynamic monocular videos. In the first stage, Video-3DGS employs an improved version of COLMAP, referred to as MC-COLMAP, which processes original videos using a Masked and Clipped approach. For each video clip, MC-COLMAP generates the point clouds for dynamic foreground objects and complex backgrounds. These point clouds are utilized to initialize two sets of 3D Gaussians (Frg-3DGS and Bkg-3DGS) aiming to represent foreground and background views. Both foreground and background views are then merged with a 2D learnable parameter map to reconstruct full views. In the second stage, we leverage the reconstruction ability developed in the first stage to impose the temporal constraints on the video diffusion model. To demonstrate the efficacy of Video-3DGS on both stages, we conduct extensive experiments across two related tasks: Video Reconstruction and Video Editing. Video-3DGS trained with 3k iterations significantly improves video reconstruction quality (+3 PSNR, +7 PSNR increase) and training efficiency (x1.9, x4.5 times faster) over NeRF-based and 3DGS-based state-of-art methods on DAVIS dataset, respectively. Moreover, it enhances video editing by ensuring temporal consistency across 58 dynamic monocular videos.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02541](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02541) |
| 227 | PLA4D: Pixel-Level Alignments for Text-to-4D Gaussian Splatting | Qiaowei Miao,Yawei Luo,Yi Yang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>As text-conditioned diffusion models (DMs) achieve breakthroughs in image, video, and 3D generation, the research community's focus has shifted to the more challenging task of text-to-4D synthesis, which introduces a temporal dimension to generate dynamic 3D objects. In this context, we identify Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), a widely used technique for text-to-3D synthesis, as a significant hindrance to text-to-4D performance due to its Janus-faced and texture-unrealistic problems coupled with high computational costs. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{P}ixel-\\textbf{L}evel \\textbf{A}lignments for Text-to-\\textbf{4D} Gaussian Splatting (\\textbf{PLA4D}), a novel method that utilizes text-to-video frames as explicit pixel alignment targets to generate static 3D objects and inject motion into them. Specifically, we introduce Focal Alignment to calibrate camera poses for rendering and GS-Mesh Contrastive Learning to distill geometry priors from rendered image contrasts at the pixel level. Additionally, we develop Motion Alignment using a deformation network to drive changes in Gaussians and implement Reference Refinement for smooth 4D object surfaces. These techniques enable 4D Gaussian Splatting to align geometry, texture, and motion with generated videos at the pixel level. Compared to previous methods, PLA4D produces synthesized outputs with better texture details in less time and effectively mitigates the Janus-faced problem.

| 226 | Adversarial Generation of Hierarchical Gaussians for 3D Generative Model | Sangeek Hyun,Jae-Pil Heo | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Most advances in 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (3D GANs) largely depend on ray casting-based volume rendering, which incurs demanding rendering costs. One promising alternative is rasterization-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), providing a much faster rendering speed and explicit 3D representation. In this paper, we exploit Gaussian as a 3D representation for 3D GANs by leveraging its efficient and explicit characteristics. However, in an adversarial framework, we observe that a na\xc3\xafve generator architecture suffers from training instability and lacks the capability to adjust the scale of Gaussians. This leads to model divergence and visual artifacts due to the absence of proper guidance for initialized positions of Gaussians and densification to manage their scales adaptively. To address these issues, we introduce a generator architecture with a hierarchical multi-scale Gaussian representation that effectively regularizes the position and scale of generated Gaussians. Specifically, we design a hierarchy of Gaussians where finer-level Gaussians are parameterized by their coarser-level counterparts; the position of finer-level Gaussians would be located near their coarser-level counterparts, and the scale would monotonically decrease as the level becomes finer, modeling both coarse and fine details of the 3D scene. Experimental results demonstrate that ours achieves a significantly faster rendering speed (x100) compared to state-of-the-art 3D consistent GANs with comparable 3D generation capability.

We present a novel approach that marries realistic physics-inspired X-ray simulation with efficient, differentiable DRR generation using 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). Our direction-disentangled 3DGS (DDGS) method separates the radiosity contribution into isotropic and direction-dependent components, approximating complex anisotropic interactions without intricate runtime simulations. Additionally, we adapt the 3DGS initialization to account for tomography data properties, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in image accuracy.

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown promise for photorealistic and real-time NVS of static scenes. Building on 3DGS, we propose an efficient point-based differentiable rendering framework for scene reconstruction from photo collections. Our key innovation is a residual-based spherical harmonic coefficients transfer module that adapts 3DGS to varying lighting conditions and photometric post-processing. This lightweight module can be pre-computed and ensures efficient gradient propagation from rendered images to 3D Gaussian attributes. Additionally, we observe that the appearance encoder and the transient mask predictor, the two most critical parts of NVS from unconstrained photo collections, can be mutually beneficial. We introduce a plug-and-play lightweight spatial attention module to simultaneously predict transient occluders and latent appearance representation for each image. After training and preprocessing, our method aligns with the standard 3DGS format and rendering pipeline, facilitating seamlessly integration into various 3DGS applications. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show our approach outperforms existing approaches on the rendering quality of novel view and appearance synthesis with high converge and rendering speed.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02407](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02407) |
| 222 | 3D Gaussian Splatting with Deferred Reflection | Keyang Ye,Qiming Hou,Kun Zhou | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The advent of neural and Gaussian-based radiance field methods have achieved great success in the field of novel view synthesis. However, specular reflection remains non-trivial, as the high frequency radiance field is notoriously difficult to fit stably and accurately. We present a deferred shading method to effectively render specular reflection with Gaussian splatting. The key challenge comes from the environment map reflection model, which requires accurate surface normal while simultaneously bottlenecks normal estimation with discontinuous gradients. We leverage the per-pixel reflection gradients generated by deferred shading to bridge the optimization process of neighboring Gaussians, allowing nearly correct normal estimations to gradually propagate and eventually spread over all reflective objects. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and concurrent work in synthesizing high-quality specular reflection effects, demonstrating a consistent improvement of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for both synthetic and real-world scenes, while running at a frame rate almost identical to vanilla Gaussian splatting.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18454](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18454) |

Our primary motivation stems from observing that existing 3DGS-based open vocabulary methods mainly focus on 2D pixel-level parsing. These methods struggle with 3D point-level tasks due to weak feature expressiveness and inaccurate 2D-3D feature associations. To ensure robust feature presentation and 3D point-level understanding, we first employ SAM masks without cross-frame associations to train instance features with 3D consistency. These features exhibit both intra-object consistency and inter-object distinction. Then, we propose a two-stage codebook to discretize these features from coarse to fine levels. At the coarse level, we consider the positional information of 3D points to achieve location-based clustering, which is then refined at the fine level. Finally, we introduce an instance-level 3D-2D feature association method that links 3D points to 2D masks, which are further associated with 2D CLIP features. Extensive experiments, including open vocabulary-based 3D object selection, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object selection, and ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

| 220 | Reconstructing and Simulating Dynamic 3D Objects with Mesh-adsorbed Gaussian Splatting | Shaojie Ma,Yawei Luo,Yi Yang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D reconstruction and simulation, while interrelated, have distinct objectives: reconstruction demands a flexible 3D representation adaptable to diverse scenes, whereas simulation requires a structured representation to model motion principles effectively. This paper introduces the Mesh-adsorbed Gaussian Splatting (MaGS) method to resolve such a dilemma. MaGS constrains 3D Gaussians to hover on the mesh surface, creating a mutual-adsorbed mesh-Gaussian 3D representation that combines the rendering flexibility of 3D Gaussians with the spatial coherence of meshes. Leveraging this representation, we introduce a learnable Relative Deformation Field (RDF) to model the relative displacement between the mesh and 3D Gaussians, extending traditional mesh-driven deformation paradigms that only rely on ARAP prior, thus capturing the motion of each 3D Gaussian more precisely. By joint optimizing meshes, 3D Gaussians, and RDF, MaGS achieves both high rendering accuracy and realistic deformation. Extensive experiments on the D-NeRF and NeRF-DS datasets demonstrate that MaGS can generate competitive results in both reconstruction and simulation.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01593](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01593) |
| 219 | A Pixel Is Worth More Than One 3D Gaussians in Single-View 3D Reconstruction | Jianghao Shen,Nan Xue,Tianfu Wu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Learning 3D scene representation from a single-view image is a long-standing fundamental problem in computer vision, with the inherent ambiguity in predicting contents unseen from the input view. Built on the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), the Splatter Image method has made promising progress on fast single-image novel view synthesis via learning a single 3D Gaussian for each pixel based on the U-Net feature map of an input image. However, it has limited expressive power to represent occluded components that are not observable in the input view. To address this problem, this paper presents a Hierarchical Splatter Image method in which a pixel is worth more than one 3D Gaussians. Specifically, each pixel is represented by a parent 3D Gaussian and a small number of child 3D Gaussians. Parent 3D Gaussians are learned as done in the vanilla Splatter Image. Child 3D Gaussians are learned via a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) which takes as input the projected image features of a parent 3D Gaussian and the embedding of a target camera view. Both parent and child 3D Gaussians are learned end-to-end in a stage-wise way. The joint condition of input image features from eyes of the parent Gaussians and the target camera position facilitates learning to allocate child Gaussians to ``see the unseen'', recovering the occluded details that are often missed by parent Gaussians.  In experiments, the proposed method is tested on the ShapeNet-SRN and CO3D datasets with state-of-the-art performance obtained, especially showing promising capabilities of reconstructing occluded contents in the input view.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20310](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20310) |

Additionally, we retrieved the 3D geometry of the scene using the 3D point cloud extracted from the 3D Gaussian Splatting model which we benchmarked against our Multi- View-Stereo dense reconstruction of the scene, thereby reconstructing both the 3D geometry and photorealistic lighting of the large-scale urban scene through 3D Gaussian Splatting</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11021) |
| 217 | TIGER: Text-Instructed 3D Gaussian Retrieval and Coherent Editing | Teng Xu,Jiamin Chen,Peng Chen,Youjia Zhang,Junqing Yu,Wei Yang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Editing objects within a scene is a critical functionality required across a broad spectrum of applications in computer vision and graphics. As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerges as a frontier in scene representation, the effective modification of 3D Gaussian scenes has become increasingly vital. This process entails accurately retrieve the target objects and subsequently performing modifications based on instructions. Though available in pieces, existing techniques mainly embed sparse semantics into Gaussians for retrieval, and rely on an iterative dataset update paradigm for editing, leading to over-smoothing or inconsistency issues. To this end, this paper proposes a systematic approach, namely TIGER, for coherent text-instructed 3D Gaussian retrieval and editing. In contrast to the top-down language grounding approach for 3D Gaussians, we adopt a bottom-up language aggregation strategy to generate a denser language embedded 3D Gaussians that supports open-vocabulary retrieval. To overcome the over-smoothing and inconsistency issues in editing, we propose a Coherent Score Distillation (CSD) that aggregates a 2D image editing diffusion model and a multi-view diffusion model for score distillation, producing multi-view consistent editing with much finer details. In various experiments, we demonstrate that our TIGER is able to accomplish more consistent and realistic edits than prior work.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14455](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14455) |
| 216 | ContextGS: Compact 3D Gaussian Splatting with Anchor Level Context Model | Yufei Wang,Zhihao Li,Lanqing Guo,Wenhan Yang,Alex C. Kot,Bihan Wen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a promising framework for novel view synthesis, offering fast rendering speeds and high fidelity. However, the large number of Gaussians and their associated attributes require effective compression techniques. Existing methods primarily compress neural Gaussians individually and independently, i.e., coding all the neural Gaussians at the same time, with little design for their interactions and spatial dependence. Inspired by the effectiveness of the context model in image compression, we propose the first autoregressive model at the anchor level for 3DGS compression in this work. We divide anchors into different levels and the anchors that are not coded yet can be predicted based on the already coded ones in all the coarser levels, leading to more accurate modeling and higher coding efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of entropy coding, e.g., to code the coarsest level with no already coded anchors, we propose to introduce a low-dimensional quantized feature as the hyperprior for each anchor, which can be effectively compressed. Our work pioneers the context model in the anchor level for 3DGS representation, yielding an impressive size reduction of over 100 times compared to vanilla 3DGS and 15 times compared to the most recent state-of-the-art work Scaffold-GS, while achieving comparable or even higher rendering quality.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20721](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20721) |

Recently, there has been a surge in NeRF-based SLAM, while 3DGS-based SLAM is sparse. A novel 3DGS-based SLAM approach with a fusion of deep visual feature, dual keyframe selection and 3DGS is presented in this paper. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed tracking is achieved by feature extraction and motion filter on each frame. The joint optimization of poses and 3D Gaussians runs through the entire mapping process. Additionally, the coarse-to-fine pose estimation and compact Gaussian scene representation are implemented by dual keyframe selection and novel loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only outperforms the existing methods in tracking and mapping, but also has less memory usage.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11129](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11129) |
| 214 | Gaussian: Self-Supervised Street Gaussians for Autonomous Driving | Nan Huang,Xiaobao Wei,Wenzhao Zheng,Pengju An,Ming Lu,Wei Zhan,Masayoshi Tomizuka,Kurt Keutzer,Shanghang Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Photorealistic 3D reconstruction of street scenes is a critical technique for developing real-world simulators for autonomous driving. Despite the efficacy of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for driving scenes, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerges as a promising direction due to its faster speed and more explicit representation. However, most existing street 3DGS methods require tracked 3D vehicle bounding boxes to decompose the static and dynamic elements for effective reconstruction, limiting their applications for in-the-wild scenarios. To facilitate efficient 3D scene reconstruction without costly annotations, we propose a self-supervised street Gaussian ($\\textit{S}^3$Gaussian) method to decompose dynamic and static elements from 4D consistency. We represent each scene with 3D Gaussians to preserve the explicitness and further accompany them with a spatial-temporal field network to compactly model the 4D dynamics. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging Waymo-Open dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Our $\\textit{S}^3$Gaussian demonstrates the ability to decompose static and dynamic scenes and achieves the best performance without using 3D annotations.

| 213 | NegGS: Negative Gaussian Splatting | Artur Kasymov,Bartosz Czekaj,Marcin Mazur,Jacek Tabor,Przemys\xc5\x82aw Spurek | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>One of the key advantages of 3D rendering is its ability to simulate intricate scenes accurately. One of the most widely used methods for this purpose is Gaussian Splatting, a novel approach that is known for its rapid training and inference capabilities. In essence, Gaussian Splatting involves incorporating data about the 3D objects of interest into a series of Gaussian distributions, each of which can then be depicted in 3D in a manner analogous to traditional meshes. It is regrettable that the use of Gaussians in Gaussian Splatting is currently somewhat restrictive due to their perceived linear nature. In practice, 3D objects are often composed of complex curves and highly nonlinear structures. This issue can to some extent be alleviated by employing a multitude of Gaussian components to reflect the complex, nonlinear structures accurately. However, this approach results in a considerable increase in time complexity. This paper introduces the concept of negative Gaussians, which are interpreted as items with negative colors. The rationale behind this approach is based on the density distribution created by dividing the probability density functions (PDFs) of two Gaussians, which we refer to as Diff-Gaussian. Such a distribution can be used to approximate structures such as donut and moon-shaped datasets. Experimental findings indicate that the application of these techniques enhances the modeling of high-frequency elements with rapid color transitions. Additionally, it improves the representation of shadows. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to extend the simple elipsoid shapes of Gaussian Splatting to more complex nonlinear structures.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18163](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18163) |

Despite yielding high reconstruction quality, existing methods suffer from slow rendering speeds and long training times, limiting their intraoperative applicability. Motivated by recent progress in 3D Gaussian Splatting, an emerging technology in real-time 3D rendering, this work presents a novel fast reconstruction framework, termed Deform3DGS, for deformable tissues during endoscopic surgery. Specifically, we introduce 3D GS into surgical scenes by integrating a point cloud initialization to improve reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a novel flexible deformation modeling scheme (FDM) to learn tissue deformation dynamics at the level of individual Gaussians. Our FDM can model the surface deformation with efficient representations, allowing for real-time rendering performance. More importantly, FDM significantly accelerates surgical scene reconstruction, demonstrating considerable clinical values, particularly in intraoperative settings where time efficiency is crucial. Experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos indicate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing superior reconstruction fidelity PSNR: (37.90) and rendering speed (338.8 FPS) while substantially reducing training time to only 1 minute/scene.

| 211 | 3D StreetUnveiler with Semantic-Aware 2DGS | Jingwei Xu,Yikai Wang,Yiqun Zhao,Yanwei Fu,Shenghua Gao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Unveiling an empty street from crowded observations captured by in-car cameras is crucial for autonomous driving. However, removing all temporarily static objects, such as stopped vehicles and standing pedestrians, presents a significant challenge. Unlike object-centric 3D inpainting, which relies on thorough observation in a small scene, street scene cases involve long trajectories that differ from previous 3D inpainting tasks. The camera-centric moving environment of captured videos further complicates the task due to the limited degree and time duration of object observation. To address these obstacles, we introduce StreetUnveiler to reconstruct an empty street. StreetUnveiler learns a 3D representation of the empty street from crowded observations. Our representation is based on the hard-label semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) for its scalability and ability to identify Gaussians to be removed. We inpaint rendered image after removing unwanted Gaussians to provide pseudo-labels and subsequently re-optimize the 2DGS. Given its temporal continuous movement, we divide the empty street scene into observed, partial-observed, and unobserved regions, which we propose to locate through a rendered alpha map. This decomposition helps us to minimize the regions that need to be inpainted. To enhance the temporal consistency of the inpainting, we introduce a novel time-reversal framework to inpaint frames in reverse order and use later frames as references for earlier frames to fully utilize the long-trajectory observations. Our experiments conducted on the street scene dataset successfully reconstructed a 3D representation of the empty street. The mesh representation of the empty street can be extracted for further applications.

However, when it comes to indoor scenes with a significant number of textureless areas, 3DGS yields incomplete and noisy reconstruction results due to the poor initialization of the point cloud and under-constrained optimization. Inspired by the continuity of signed distance field (SDF), which naturally has advantages in modeling surfaces, we present a unified optimizing framework integrating neural SDF with 3DGS. This framework incorporates a learnable neural SDF field to guide the densification and pruning of Gaussians, enabling Gaussians to accurately model scenes even with poor initialized point clouds. At the same time, the geometry represented by Gaussians improves the efficiency of the SDF field by piloting its point sampling. Additionally, we regularize the optimization with normal and edge priors to eliminate geometry ambiguity in textureless areas and improve the details. Extensive experiments in ScanNet and ScanNet++ show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19671](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19671) |
| 209 | Uncertainty-guided Optimal Transport in Depth Supervised Sparse-View 3D Gaussian | Wei Sun,Qi Zhang,Yanzhao Zhou,Qixiang Ye,Jianbin Jiao,Yuan Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian splatting has demonstrated impressive performance in real-time novel view synthesis. However, achieving successful reconstruction from RGB images generally requires multiple input views captured under static conditions. To address the challenge of sparse input views, previous approaches have incorporated depth supervision into the training of 3D Gaussians to mitigate overfitting, using dense predictions from pretrained depth networks as pseudo-ground truth. Nevertheless, depth predictions from monocular depth estimation models inherently exhibit significant uncertainty in specific areas. Relying solely on pixel-wise L2 loss may inadvertently incorporate detrimental noise from these uncertain areas. In this work, we introduce a novel method to supervise the depth distribution of 3D Gaussians, utilizing depth priors with integrated uncertainty estimates. To address these localized errors in depth predictions, we integrate a patch-wise optimal transport strategy to complement traditional L2 loss in depth supervision. Extensive experiments conducted on the LLFF, DTU, and Blender datasets demonstrate that our approach, UGOT, achieves superior novel view synthesis and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19657](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19657) |
| 208 | TAMBRIDGE: Bridging Frame-Centered Tracking and 3D Gaussian Splatting for Enhanced SLAM | Peifeng Jiang,Hong Liu,Xia Li,Ti Wang,Fabian Zhang,Joachim M. Buhmann | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The limited robustness of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to motion blur and camera noise, along with its poor real-time performance, restricts its application in robotic SLAM tasks. Upon analysis, the primary causes of these issues are the density of views with motion blur and the cumulative errors in dense pose estimation from calculating losses based on noisy original images and rendering results, which increase the difficulty of 3DGS rendering convergence. Thus, a cutting-edge 3DGS-based SLAM system is introduced, leveraging the efficiency and flexibility of 3DGS to achieve real-time performance while remaining robust against sensor noise, motion blur, and the challenges posed by long-session SLAM. Central to this approach is the Fusion Bridge module, which seamlessly integrates tracking-centered ORB Visual Odometry with mapping-centered online 3DGS. Precise pose initialization is enabled by this module through joint optimization of re-projection and rendering loss, as well as strategic view selection, enhancing rendering convergence in large-scale scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art rendering quality and localization accuracy, positioning this system as a promising solution for real-world robotics applications that require stable, near-real-time performance.

| 207 | Memorize What Matters: Emergent Scene Decomposition from Multitraverse | Yiming Li,Zehong Wang,Yue Wang,Zhiding Yu,Zan Gojcic,Marco Pavone,Chen Feng,Jose M. Alvarez | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Humans naturally retain memories of permanent elements, while ephemeral moments often slip through the cracks of memory. This selective retention is crucial for robotic perception, localization, and mapping. To endow robots with this capability, we introduce 3D Gaussian Mapping (3DGM), a self-supervised, camera-only offline mapping framework grounded in 3D Gaussian Splatting. 3DGM converts multitraverse RGB videos from the same region into a Gaussian-based environmental map while concurrently performing 2D ephemeral object segmentation. Our key observation is that the environment remains consistent across traversals, while objects frequently change. This allows us to exploit self-supervision from repeated traversals to achieve environment-object decomposition. More specifically, 3DGM formulates multitraverse environmental mapping as a robust differentiable rendering problem, treating pixels of the environment and objects as inliers and outliers, respectively. Using robust feature distillation, feature residuals mining, and robust optimization, 3DGM jointly performs 2D segmentation and 3D mapping without human intervention. We build the Mapverse benchmark, sourced from the Ithaca365 and nuPlan datasets, to evaluate our method in unsupervised 2D segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and neural rendering. Extensive results verify the effectiveness and potential of our method for self-driving and robotics.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17187](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17187) |
| 206 | PyGS: Large-scale Scene Representation with Pyramidal 3D Gaussian Splatting | Zipeng Wang,Dan Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in synthesizing photorealistic images of large-scale scenes. However, they are often plagued by a loss of fine details and long rendering durations. 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently been introduced as a potent alternative, achieving both high-fidelity visual results and accelerated rendering performance. Nonetheless, scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting is fraught with challenges. Specifically, large-scale scenes grapples with the integration of objects across multiple scales and disparate viewpoints, which often leads to compromised efficacy as the Gaussians need to balance between detail levels. Furthermore, the generation of initialization points via COLMAP from large-scale dataset is both computationally demanding and prone to incomplete reconstructions. To address these challenges, we present Pyramidal 3D Gaussian Splatting (PyGS) with NeRF Initialization. Our approach represent the scene with a hierarchical assembly of Gaussians arranged in a pyramidal fashion. The top level of the pyramid is composed of a few large Gaussians, while each subsequent layer accommodates a denser collection of smaller Gaussians. We effectively initialize these pyramidal Gaussians through sampling a rapidly trained grid-based NeRF at various frequencies. We group these pyramidal Gaussians into clusters and use a compact weighting network to dynamically determine the influence of each pyramid level of each cluster considering camera viewpoint during rendering. Our method achieves a significant performance leap across multiple large-scale datasets and attains a rendering time that is over 400 times faster than current state-of-the-art approaches.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16829](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16829) |

In addition, to reduce cumulative drift in tracking and improve semantic reconstruction accuracy, we introduce semantic-informed bundle adjustment leveraging multi-frame semantic associations for joint optimization of 3D Gaussian representation and camera poses, leading to low-drift tracking and accurate mapping. Our SemGauss-SLAM method demonstrates superior performance over existing radiance field-based SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on Replica and ScanNet datasets, while also showing excellent capabilities in high-precision semantic segmentation and dense semantic mapping.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07494](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07494) |
| 204 | LP-3DGS: Learning to Prune 3D Gaussian Splatting | Zhaoliang Zhang,Tianchen Song,Yongjae Lee,Li Yang,Cheng Peng,Rama Chellappa,Deliang Fan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the mainstream methodologies for novel view synthesis (NVS) due to its high quality and fast rendering speed. However, as a point-based scene representation, 3DGS potentially generates a large number of Gaussians to fit the scene, leading to high memory usage. Improvements that have been proposed require either an empirical and preset pruning ratio or importance score threshold to prune the point cloud. Such hyperparamter requires multiple rounds of training to optimize and achieve the maximum pruning ratio, while maintaining the rendering quality for each scene. In this work, we propose learning-to-prune 3DGS (LP-3DGS), where a trainable binary mask is applied to the importance score that can find optimal pruning ratio automatically. Instead of using the traditional straight-through estimator (STE) method to approximate the binary mask gradient, we redesign the masking function to leverage the Gumbel-Sigmoid method, making it differentiable and compatible with the existing training process of 3DGS. Extensive experiments have shown that LP-3DGS consistently produces a good balance that is both efficient and high quality.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18784](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18784) |

However, its training heavily depends on high-quality, sharp images and accurate camera poses. Fulfilling these requirements can be challenging in non-ideal real-world scenarios, where motion-blurred images are commonly encountered in high-speed moving cameras or low-light environments that require long exposure times. To address these challenges, we introduce Event Stream Assisted Gaussian Splatting (EvaGaussians), a novel approach that integrates event streams captured by an event camera to assist in reconstructing high-quality 3D-GS from blurry images. Capitalizing on the high temporal resolution and dynamic range offered by the event camera, we leverage the event streams to explicitly model the formation process of motion-blurred images and guide the deblurring reconstruction of 3D-GS. By jointly optimizing the 3D-GS parameters and recovering camera motion trajectories during the exposure time, our method can robustly facilitate the acquisition of high-fidelity novel views with intricate texture details. We comprehensively evaluated our method and compared it with previous state-of-the-art deblurring rendering methods. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our method surpasses existing techniques in restoring fine details from blurry images and producing high-fidelity novel views.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20224](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20224) |

While neural rendering techniques have made significant strides in driving scenarios, existing methods are primarily designed for videos collected by autonomous vehicles. However, these videos are limited in both quantity and diversity compared to dash cam videos, which are more widely used across various types of vehicles and capture a broader range of scenarios. Dash cam videos often suffer from severe obstructions such as reflections and occlusions on the windshields, which significantly impede the application of neural rendering techniques. To address this challenge, we develop DC-Gaussian based on the recent real-time neural rendering technique 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach includes an adaptive image decomposition module to model reflections and occlusions in a unified manner. Additionally, we introduce illumination-aware obstruction modeling to manage reflections and occlusions under varying lighting conditions. Lastly, we employ a geometry-guided Gaussian enhancement strategy to improve rendering details by incorporating additional geometry priors.

| 201 | Multi-Scale 3D Gaussian Splatting for Anti-Aliased Rendering | Zhiwen Yan,Weng Fei Low,Yu Chen,Gim Hee Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussians have recently emerged as a highly efficient representation for 3D reconstruction and rendering. Despite its high rendering quality and speed at high resolutions, they both deteriorate drastically when rendered at lower resolutions or from far away camera position. During low resolution or far away rendering, the pixel size of the image can fall below the Nyquist frequency compared to the screen size of each splatted 3D Gaussian and leads to aliasing effect. The rendering is also drastically slowed down by the sequential alpha blending of more splatted Gaussians per pixel. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm, which maintains Gaussians at different scales to represent the same scene. Higher-resolution images are rendered with more small Gaussians, and lower-resolution images are rendered with fewer larger Gaussians. With similar training time, our algorithm can achieve 13\\%-66\\% PSNR and 160\\%-2400\\% rendering speed improvement at 4$\\times$-128$\\times$ scale rendering on Mip-NeRF360 dataset compared to the single scale 3D Gaussian splitting.

| 200 | GFlow: Recovering 4D World from Monocular Video | Shizun Wang,Xingyi Yang,Qiuhong Shen,Zhenxiang Jiang,Xinchao Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing 4D scenes from video inputs is a crucial yet challenging task. Conventional methods usually rely on the assumptions of multi-view video inputs, known camera parameters, or static scenes, all of which are typically absent under in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we relax all these constraints and tackle a highly ambitious but practical task, which we termed as AnyV4D: we assume only one monocular video is available without any camera parameters as input, and we aim to recover the dynamic 4D world alongside the camera poses. To this end, we introduce GFlow, a new framework that utilizes only 2D priors (depth and optical flow) to lift a video (3D) to a 4D explicit representation, entailing a flow of Gaussian splatting through space and time. GFlow first clusters the scene into still and moving parts, then applies a sequential optimization process that optimizes camera poses and the dynamics of 3D Gaussian points based on 2D priors and scene clustering, ensuring fidelity among neighboring points and smooth movement across frames. Since dynamic scenes always introduce new content, we also propose a new pixel-wise densification strategy for Gaussian points to integrate new visual content. Moreover, GFlow transcends the boundaries of mere 4D reconstruction; it also enables tracking of any points across frames without the need for prior training and segments moving objects from the scene in an unsupervised way. Additionally, the camera poses of each frame can be derived from GFlow, allowing for rendering novel views of a video scene through changing camera pose. By employing the explicit representation, we may readily conduct scene-level or object-level editing as desired, underscoring its versatility and power.

Despite its advancements, the high computational costs of NeRF have posed challenges for its deployment in resource-constrained environments and real-time applications. As an alternative to NeRF-like neural rendering methods, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers rapid rendering speeds while maintaining excellent image quality. However, as it represents objects and scenes using a myriad of Gaussians, it requires substantial storage to achieve high-quality representation. To mitigate the storage overhead, we propose Factorized 3D Gaussian Splatting (F-3DGS), a novel approach that drastically reduces storage requirements while preserving image quality. Inspired by classical matrix and tensor factorization techniques, our method represents and approximates dense clusters of Gaussians with significantly fewer Gaussians through efficient factorization. We aim to efficiently represent dense 3D Gaussians by approximating them with a limited amount of information for each axis and their combinations. This method allows us to encode a substantially large number of Gaussians along with their essential attributes -- such as color, scale, and rotation -- necessary for rendering using a relatively small number of elements. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that F-3DGS achieves a significant reduction in storage costs while maintaining comparable quality in rendered images.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17083](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17083) |

However, 3DGS heavily depends on the accurate initialization derived from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods. When the quality of the initial point cloud deteriorates, such as in the presence of noise or when using randomly initialized point cloud, 3DGS often undergoes large performance drops. To address this limitation, we propose a novel optimization strategy dubbed RAIN-GS (Relaing Accurate Initialization Constraint for 3D Gaussian Splatting). Our approach is based on an in-depth analysis of the original 3DGS optimization scheme and the analysis of the SfM initialization in the frequency domain. Leveraging simple modifications based on our analyses, RAIN-GS successfully trains 3D Gaussians from sub-optimal point cloud (e.g., randomly initialized point cloud), effectively relaxing the need for accurate initialization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our strategy through quantitative and qualitative comparisons on multiple datasets, where RAIN-GS trained with random point cloud achieves performance on-par with or even better than 3DGS trained with accurate SfM point cloud.

| 196 | A Grid-Free Fluid Solver based on Gaussian Spatial Representation | Jingrui Xing,Bin Wang,Mengyu Chu,Baoquan Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present a grid-free fluid solver featuring a novel Gaussian representation. Drawing inspiration from the expressive capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting in multi-view image reconstruction, we model the continuous flow velocity as a weighted sum of multiple Gaussian functions. Leveraging this representation, we derive differential operators for the field and implement a time-dependent PDE solver using the traditional operator splitting method. Compared to implicit neural representations as another continuous spatial representation with increasing attention, our method with flexible 3D Gaussians presents enhanced accuracy on vorticity preservation. Moreover, we apply physics-driven strategies to accelerate the optimization-based time integration of Gaussian functions. This temporal evolution surpasses previous work based on implicit neural representation with reduced computational time and memory. Although not surpassing the quality of state-of-the-art Eulerian methods in fluid simulation, experiments and ablation studies indicate the potential of our memory-efficient representation. With enriched spatial information, our method exhibits a distinctive perspective combining the advantages of Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18133](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18133) |
| 195 | EG4D: Explicit Generation of 4D Object without Score Distillation | Qi Sun,Zhiyang Guo,Ziyu Wan,Jing Nathan Yan,Shengming Yin,Wengang Zhou,Jing Liao,Houqiang Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In recent years, the increasing demand for dynamic 3D assets in design and gaming applications has given rise to powerful generative pipelines capable of synthesizing high-quality 4D objects. Previous methods generally rely on score distillation sampling (SDS) algorithm to infer the unseen views and motion of 4D objects, thus leading to unsatisfactory results with defects like over-saturation and Janus problem. Therefore, inspired by recent progress of video diffusion models, we propose to optimize a 4D representation by explicitly generating multi-view videos from one input image. However, it is far from trivial to handle practical challenges faced by such a pipeline, including dramatic temporal inconsistency, inter-frame geometry and texture diversity, and semantic defects brought by video generation results. To address these issues, we propose DG4D, a novel multi-stage framework that generates high-quality and consistent 4D assets without score distillation. Specifically, collaborative techniques and solutions are developed, including an attention injection strategy to synthesize temporal-consistent multi-view videos, a robust and efficient dynamic reconstruction method based on Gaussian Splatting, and a refinement stage with diffusion prior for semantic restoration. The qualitative results and user preference study demonstrate that our framework outperforms the baselines in generation quality by a considerable margin.

| 194 | SA-GS: Semantic-Aware Gaussian Splatting for Large Scene Reconstruction with Geometry Constrain | Butian Xiong,Xiaoyu Ye,Tze Ho Elden Tse,Kai Han,Shuguang Cui,Zhen Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the emergence of Gaussian Splats, recent efforts have focused on large-scale scene geometric reconstruction. However, most of these efforts either concentrate on memory reduction or spatial space division, neglecting information in the semantic space. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named SA-GS, for fine-grained 3D geometry reconstruction using semantic-aware 3D Gaussian Splats. Specifically, we leverage prior information stored in large vision models such as SAM and DINO to generate semantic masks. We then introduce a geometric complexity measurement function to serve as soft regularization, guiding the shape of each Gaussian Splat within specific semantic areas. Additionally, we present a method that estimates the expected number of Gaussian Splats in different semantic areas, effectively providing a lower bound for Gaussian Splats in these areas. Subsequently, we extract the point cloud using a novel probability density-based extraction method, transforming Gaussian Splats into a point cloud crucial for downstream tasks. Our method also offers the potential for detailed semantic inquiries while maintaining high image-based reconstruction results. We provide extensive experiments on publicly available large-scale scene reconstruction datasets with highly accurate point clouds as ground truth and our novel dataset. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our method over current state-of-the-art Gaussian Splats reconstruction methods by a significant margin in terms of geometric-based measurement metrics. Code and additional results will soon be available on our project page.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16923](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16923) |
| 193 | A Refined 3D Gaussian Representation for High-Quality Dynamic Scene Reconstruction | Bin Zhang,Bi Zeng,Zexin Peng | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has revolutionized three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction with its implicit representation. Building upon NeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has departed from the implicit representation of neural networks and instead directly represents scenes as point clouds with Gaussian-shaped distributions. While this shift has notably elevated the rendering quality and speed of radiance fields but inevitably led to a significant increase in memory usage. Additionally, effectively rendering dynamic scenes in 3D-GS has emerged as a pressing challenge. To address these concerns, this paper purposes a refined 3D Gaussian representation for high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction. Firstly, we use a deformable multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to capture the dynamic offset of Gaussian points and express the color features of points through hash encoding and a tiny MLP to reduce storage requirements. Subsequently, we introduce a learnable denoising mask coupled with denoising loss to eliminate noise points from the scene, thereby further compressing 3D Gaussian model. Finally, motion noise of points is mitigated through static constraints and motion consistency constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in rendering quality and speed, while significantly reducing the memory usage associated with 3D-GS, making it highly suitable for various tasks such as novel view synthesis, and dynamic mapping.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17891](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17891) |
| 192 | Mani-GS: Gaussian Splatting Manipulation with Triangular Mesh | Xiangjun Gao,Xiaoyu Li,Yiyu Zhuang,Qi Zhang,Wenbo Hu,Chaopeng Zhang,Yao Yao,Ying Shan,Long Quan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Neural 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), excel at producing photo-realistic rendering results but lack the flexibility for manipulation and editing which is crucial for content creation. Previous works have attempted to address this issue by deforming a NeRF in canonical space or manipulating the radiance field based on an explicit mesh. However, manipulating NeRF is not highly controllable and requires a long training and inference time. With the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), extremely high-fidelity novel view synthesis can be achieved using an explicit point-based 3D representation with much faster training and rendering speed. However, there is still a lack of effective means to manipulate 3DGS freely while maintaining rendering quality. In this work, we aim to tackle the challenge of achieving manipulable photo-realistic rendering. We propose to utilize a triangular mesh to manipulate 3DGS directly with self-adaptation. This approach reduces the need to design various algorithms for different types of Gaussian manipulation. By utilizing a triangle shape-aware Gaussian binding and adapting method, we can achieve 3DGS manipulation and preserve high-fidelity rendering after manipulation. Our approach is capable of handling large deformations, local manipulations, and soft body simulations while keeping high-quality rendering. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is also effective with inaccurate meshes extracted from 3DGS. Experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over baseline approaches.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17811](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17811) |
| 191 | SafeguardGS: 3D Gaussian Primitive Pruning While Avoiding Catastrophic Scene Destruction | Yongjae Lee,Zhaoliang Zhang,Deliang Fan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made a significant stride in novel view synthesis, demonstrating top-notch rendering quality while achieving real-time rendering speed. However, the excessively large number of Gaussian primitives resulting from 3DGS' suboptimal densification process poses a major challenge, slowing down frame-per-second (FPS) and demanding considerable memory cost, making it unfavorable for low-end devices. To cope with this issue, many follow-up studies have suggested various pruning techniques, often in combination with different score functions, to optimize rendering performance. Nonetheless, a comprehensive discussion regarding their effectiveness and implications across all techniques is missing. In this paper, we first categorize 3DGS pruning techniques into two types: Cross-view pruning and pixel-wise pruning, which differ in their approaches to rank primitives. Our subsequent experiments reveal that while cross-view pruning leads to disastrous quality drops under extreme Gaussian primitives decimation, the pixel-wise pruning technique not only sustains relatively high rendering quality with minuscule performance degradation but also provides a reasonable minimum boundary for pruning. Building on this observation, we further propose multiple variations of score functions and empirically discover that the color-weighted score function outperforms others for discriminating insignificant primitives for rendering. We believe our research provides valuable insights for optimizing 3DGS pruning strategies for future works.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17793](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17793) |
| 190 | GaussianFormer: Scene as Gaussians for Vision-Based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction | Yuanhui Huang,Wenzhao Zheng,Yunpeng Zhang,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to obtain 3D fine-grained geometry and semantics of the surrounding scene and is an important task for the robustness of vision-centric autonomous driving. Most existing methods employ dense grids such as voxels as scene representations, which ignore the sparsity of occupancy and the diversity of object scales and thus lead to unbalanced allocation of resources. To address this, we propose an object-centric representation to describe 3D scenes with sparse 3D semantic Gaussians where each Gaussian represents a flexible region of interest and its semantic features. We aggregate information from images through the attention mechanism and iteratively refine the properties of 3D Gaussians including position, covariance, and semantics. We then propose an efficient Gaussian-to-voxel splatting method to generate 3D occupancy predictions, which only aggregates the neighboring Gaussians for a certain position. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely adopted nuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GaussianFormer achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods with only 17.8% - 24.8% of their memory consumption.

To address such a challenging and ill-posed inverse problem, we leverage prior knowledge from foundational vision models, lift the video data to a novel Motion Scaffold (MoSca) representation, which compactly and smoothly encodes the underlying motions / deformations. The scene geometry and appearance are then disentangled from the deformation field, and are encoded by globally fusing the Gaussians anchored onto the MoSca and optimized via Gaussian Splatting. Additionally, camera poses can be seamlessly initialized and refined during the dynamic rendering process, without the need for other pose estimation tools.

| 188 | DOF-GS: Adjustable Depth-of-Field 3D Gaussian Splatting for Refocusing,Defocus Rendering and Blur Removal | Yujie Wang,Praneeth Chakravarthula,Baoquan Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting-based techniques have recently advanced 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, achieving high-quality real-time rendering. However, these approaches are inherently limited by the underlying pinhole camera assumption in modeling the images and hence only work for All-in-Focus (AiF) sharp image inputs. This severely affects their applicability in real-world scenarios where images often exhibit defocus blur due to the limited depth-of-field (DOF) of imaging devices. Additionally, existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods also do not support rendering of DOF effects.  To address these challenges, we introduce DOF-GS that allows for rendering adjustable DOF effects, removing defocus blur as well as refocusing of 3D scenes, all from multi-view images degraded by defocus blur. To this end, we re-imagine the traditional Gaussian Splatting pipeline by employing a finite aperture camera model coupled with explicit, differentiable defocus rendering guided by the Circle-of-Confusion (CoC). The proposed framework provides for dynamic adjustment of DOF effects by changing the aperture and focal distance of the underlying camera model on-demand. It also enables rendering varying DOF effects of 3D scenes post-optimization, and generating AiF images from defocused training images. Furthermore, we devise a joint optimization strategy to further enhance details in the reconstructed scenes by jointly optimizing rendered defocused and AiF images. Our experimental results indicate that DOF-GS produces high-quality sharp all-in-focus renderings conditioned on inputs compromised by defocus blur, with the training process incurring only a modest increase in GPU memory consumption. We further demonstrate the applications of the proposed method for adjustable defocus rendering and refocusing of the 3D scene from input images degraded by defocus blur.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17351](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17351) |
| 187 | Segment Any 3D Gaussians | Jiazhong Cen,Jiemin Fang,Chen Yang,Lingxi Xie,Xiaopeng Zhang,Wei Shen,Qi Tian | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper presents SAGA (Segment Any 3D GAussians), a highly efficient 3D promptable segmentation method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Given 2D visual prompts as input, SAGA can segment the corresponding 3D target represented by 3D Gaussians within 4 ms. This is achieved by attaching an scale-gated affinity feature to each 3D Gaussian to endow it a new property towards multi-granularity segmentation. Specifically, a scale-aware contrastive training strategy is proposed for the scale-gated affinity feature learning. It 1) distills the segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) from 2D masks into the affinity features and 2) employs a soft scale gate mechanism to deal with multi-granularity ambiguity in 3D segmentation through adjusting the magnitude of each feature channel according to a specified 3D physical scale. Evaluations demonstrate that SAGA achieves real-time multi-granularity segmentation with quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods. As one of the first methods addressing promptable segmentation in 3D-GS, the simplicity and effectiveness of SAGA pave the way for future advancements in this field.

Plataniotis,Yao Zhao,Yunchao Wei | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The availability of large-scale multimodal datasets and advancements in diffusion models have significantly accelerated progress in 4D content generation. Most prior approaches rely on multiple image or video diffusion models, utilizing score distillation sampling for optimization or generating pseudo novel views for direct supervision. However, these methods are hindered by slow optimization speeds and multi-view inconsistency issues. Spatial and temporal consistency in 4D geometry has been extensively explored respectively in 3D-aware diffusion models and traditional monocular video diffusion models. Building on this foundation, we propose a strategy to migrate the temporal consistency in video diffusion models to the spatial-temporal consistency required for 4D generation. Specifically, we present a novel framework, \\textbf{Diffusion4D}, for efficient and scalable 4D content generation. Leveraging a meticulously curated dynamic 3D dataset, we develop a 4D-aware video diffusion model capable of synthesizing orbital views of dynamic 3D assets. To control the dynamic strength of these assets, we introduce a 3D-to-4D motion magnitude metric as guidance. Additionally, we propose a novel motion magnitude reconstruction loss and 3D-aware classifier-free guidance to refine the learning and generation of motion dynamics. After obtaining orbital views of the 4D asset, we perform explicit 4D construction with Gaussian splatting in a coarse-to-fine manner. The synthesized multi-view consistent 4D image set enables us to swiftly generate high-fidelity and diverse 4D assets within just several minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generation efficiency and 4D geometry consistency across various prompt modalities.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16645](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16645) |

Oswald,Federico Tombari | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful representation of geometry and appearance for RGB-only dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), as it provides a compact dense map representation while enabling efficient and high-quality map rendering. However, existing methods show significantly worse reconstruction quality than competing methods using other 3D representations, e.g. neural points clouds, since they either do not employ global map and pose optimization or make use of monocular depth. In response, we propose the first RGB-only SLAM system with a dense 3D Gaussian map representation that utilizes all benefits of globally optimized tracking by adapting dynamically to keyframe pose and depth updates by actively deforming the 3D Gaussian map. Moreover, we find that refining the depth updates in inaccurate areas with a monocular depth estimator further improves the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction. Our experiments on the Replica, TUM-RGBD, and ScanNet datasets indicate the effectiveness of globally optimized 3D Gaussians, as the approach achieves superior or on par performance with existing RGB-only SLAM methods methods in tracking, mapping and rendering accuracy while yielding small map sizes and fast runtimes.

Recent works usually adopt MLP-based neural radiance fields (NeRF) to represent 3D humans, but it remains difficult for pure MLPs to regress pose-dependent garment details. To this end, we introduce Animatable Gaussians, a new avatar representation that leverages powerful 2D CNNs and 3D Gaussian splatting to create high-fidelity avatars. To associate 3D Gaussians with the animatable avatar, we learn a parametric template from the input videos, and then parameterize the template on two front & back canonical Gaussian maps where each pixel represents a 3D Gaussian. The learned template is adaptive to the wearing garments for modeling looser clothes like dresses. Such template-guided 2D parameterization enables us to employ a powerful StyleGAN-based CNN to learn the pose-dependent Gaussian maps for modeling detailed dynamic appearances. Furthermore, we introduce a pose projection strategy for better generalization given novel poses. To tackle the realistic relighting of animatable avatars, we introduce physically-based rendering into the avatar representation for decomposing avatar materials and environment illumination. Overall, our method can create lifelike avatars with dynamic, realistic, generalized and relightable appearances. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16096](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16096) |

Existing methods for single-image 3D reconstruction are primarily based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with Neural 3D representations. Despite promising results, these approaches encounter practical limitations due to lengthy optimizations and significant memory consumption. In this work, we introduce Gamba, an end-to-end 3D reconstruction model from a single-view image, emphasizing two main insights: (1) Efficient Backbone Design: introducing a Mamba-based GambaFormer network to model 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstruction as sequential prediction with linear scalability of token length, thereby accommodating a substantial number of Gaussians; (2) Robust Gaussian Constraints: deriving radial mask constraints from multi-view masks to eliminate the need for warmup supervision of 3D point clouds in training. We trained Gamba on Objaverse and assessed it against existing optimization-based and feed-forward 3D reconstruction approaches on the GSO Dataset, among which Gamba is the only end-to-end trained single-view reconstruction model with 3DGS. Experimental results demonstrate its competitive generation capabilities both qualitatively and quantitatively and highlight its remarkable speed: Gamba completes reconstruction within 0.05 seconds on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, which is about $1,000\\times$ faster than optimization-based methods.

However, it may require a large number of Gaussians, which creates a substantial memory footprint. This paper introduces GES (Generalized Exponential Splatting), a novel representation that employs Generalized Exponential Function (GEF) to model 3D scenes, requiring far fewer particles to represent a scene and thus significantly outperforming Gaussian Splatting methods in efficiency with a plug-and-play replacement ability for Gaussian-based utilities. GES is validated theoretically and empirically in both principled 1D setup and realistic 3D scenes.  It is shown to represent signals with sharp edges more accurately, which are typically challenging for Gaussians due to their inherent low-pass characteristics. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that GEF outperforms Gaussians in fitting natural-occurring signals (e.g. squares, triangles, and parabolic signals), thereby reducing the need for extensive splitting operations that increase the memory footprint of Gaussian Splatting. With the aid of a frequency-modulated loss, GES achieves competitive performance in novel-view synthesis benchmarks while requiring less than half the memory storage of Gaussian Splatting and increasing the rendering speed by up to 39%.

Such solutions use GS to represent the scene's structure and the neural network to model dynamics. Such approaches allow fast rendering and extracting each element of such a dynamic scene. However, modifying such objects over time is challenging. SC-GS (Sparse Controlled Gaussian Splatting) enhanced with Deformed Control Points partially solves this issue. However, this approach necessitates selecting elements that need to be kept fixed, as well as centroids that should be adjusted throughout editing. Moreover, this task poses additional difficulties regarding the re-productivity of such editing. To address this, we propose Dynamic Multi-Gaussian Soup (D-MiSo), which allows us to model the mesh-inspired representation of dynamic GS. Additionally, we propose a strategy of linking parameterized Gaussian splats, forming a Triangle Soup with the estimated mesh. Consequently, we can separately construct new trajectories for the 3D objects composing the scene. Thus, we can make the scene's dynamic editable over time or while maintaining partial dynamics.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14276](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14276) |

We also propose an automatic cage construction algorithm for 3DGS to minimize manual work. Our method does not modify the underlying architecture of 3DGS. Therefore, any existing trained vanilla 3DGS can be easily edited by our method.

Recently, mesh-based road surface reconstruction algorithms show promising reconstruction results. However, these mesh-based methods suffer from slow speed and poor rendering quality. In contrast, the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows superior rendering speed and quality. Although 3DGS employs explicit Gaussian spheres to represent the scene, it lacks the ability to directly represent the geometric information of the scene. To address this limitation, we propose a novel large-scale road surface reconstruction approach based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), named RoGS. The geometric shape of the road is explicitly represented using 2D Gaussian surfels, where each surfel stores color, semantics, and geometric information. Compared to Gaussian spheres, the Gaussian surfels aligns more closely with the physical reality of the road. Distinct from previous initialization methods that rely on point clouds for Gaussian spheres, we introduce a trajectory-based initialization for Gaussian surfels. Thanks to the explicit representation of the Gaussian surfels and a good initialization, our method achieves a significant acceleration while improving reconstruction quality. We achieve excellent results in reconstruction of roads surfaces in a variety of challenging real-world scenes.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14342](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14342) |

Despite its advantages, Gaussian Splatting's reliance on high-quality point cloud initialization by Structure-from-Motion (SFM) algorithms is a significant limitation to be overcome. To this end, we investigate various initialization strategies for Gaussian Splatting and delve into how volumetric reconstructions from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can be utilized to bypass the dependency on SFM data. Our findings demonstrate that random initialization can perform much better if carefully designed and that by employing a combination of improved initialization strategies and structure distillation from low-cost NeRF models, it is possible to achieve equivalent results, or at times even superior, to those obtained from SFM initialization.

Compared to previous systems, Tele-Aloha utilizes only four sparse RGB cameras, one consumer-grade GPU, and one autostereoscopic screen to achieve high-resolution (2048x2048), real-time (30 fps), low-latency (less than 150ms) and robust distant communication. As the core of Tele-Aloha, we propose an efficient novel view synthesis algorithm for upper-body. Firstly, we design a cascaded disparity estimator for obtaining a robust geometry cue. Additionally a neural rasterizer via Gaussian Splatting is introduced to project latent features onto target view and to decode them into a reduced resolution. Further, given the high-quality captured data, we leverage weighted blending mechanism to refine the decoded image into the final resolution of 2K. Exploiting world-leading autostereoscopic display and low-latency iris tracking, users are able to experience a strong three-dimensional sense even without any wearable head-mounted display device. Altogether, our telepresence system demonstrates the sense of co-presence in real-life experiments, inspiring the next generation of communication.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14866](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14866) |
| 175 | GaussianVTON: 3D Human Virtual Try-ON via Multi-Stage Gaussian Splatting Editing with Image Prompting | Haodong Chen,Yongle Huang,Haojian Huang,Xiangsheng Ge,Dian Shao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The increasing prominence of e-commerce has underscored the importance of Virtual Try-On (VTON). However, previous studies predominantly focus on the 2D realm and rely heavily on extensive data for training. Research on 3D VTON primarily centers on garment-body shape compatibility, a topic extensively covered in 2D VTON. Thanks to advances in 3D scene editing, a 2D diffusion model has now been adapted for 3D editing via multi-viewpoint editing. In this work, we propose GaussianVTON, an innovative 3D VTON pipeline integrating Gaussian Splatting (GS) editing with 2D VTON. To facilitate a seamless transition from 2D to 3D VTON, we propose, for the first time, the use of only images as editing prompts for 3D editing. To further address issues, e.g., face blurring, garment inaccuracy, and degraded viewpoint quality during editing, we devise a three-stage refinement strategy to gradually mitigate potential issues. Furthermore, we introduce a new editing strategy termed Edit Recall Reconstruction (ERR) to tackle the limitations of previous editing strategies in leading to complex geometric changes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GaussianVTON, offering a novel perspective on 3D VTON while also establishing a novel starting point for image-prompting 3D scene editing.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07472](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07472) |
| 174 | AtomGS: Atomizing Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity Radiance Field | Rong Liu,Rui Xu,Yue Hu,Meida Chen,Andrew Feng | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently advanced radiance field reconstruction by offering superior capabilities for novel view synthesis and real-time rendering speed. However, its strategy of blending optimization and adaptive density control might lead to sub-optimal results; it can sometimes yield noisy geometry and blurry artifacts due to prioritizing optimizing large Gaussians at the cost of adequately densifying smaller ones. To address this, we introduce AtomGS, consisting of Atomized Proliferation and Geometry-Guided Optimization. The Atomized Proliferation constrains ellipsoid Gaussians of various sizes into more uniform-sized Atom Gaussians. The strategy enhances the representation of areas with fine features by placing greater emphasis on densification in accordance with scene details. In addition, we proposed a Geometry-Guided Optimization approach that incorporates an Edge-Aware Normal Loss. This optimization method effectively smooths flat surfaces while preserving intricate details. Our evaluation shows that AtomGS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality. Additionally, it achieves competitive accuracy in geometry reconstruction and offers a significant improvement in training speed over other SDF-based methods. More interactive demos can be found in our website (https://rongliu-leo.github.io/AtomGS/).</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12369](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12369) |
| 173 | Gaussian Time Machine: A Real-Time Rendering Methodology for Time-Variant Appearances | Licheng Shen,Ho Ngai Chow,Lingyun Wang,Tong Zhang,Mengqiu Wang,Yuxing Han | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in neural rendering techniques have significantly enhanced the fidelity of 3D reconstruction. Notably, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant milestone by adopting a discrete scene representation, facilitating efficient training and real-time rendering. Several studies have successfully extended the real-time rendering capability of 3DGS to dynamic scenes. However, a challenge arises when training images are captured under vastly differing weather and lighting conditions. This scenario poses a challenge for 3DGS and its variants in achieving accurate reconstructions. Although NeRF-based methods (NeRF-W, CLNeRF) have shown promise in handling such challenging conditions, their computational demands hinder real-time rendering capabilities. In this paper, we present Gaussian Time Machine (GTM) which models the time-dependent attributes of Gaussian primitives with discrete time embedding vectors decoded by a lightweight Multi-Layer-Perceptron(MLP). By adjusting the opacity of Gaussian primitives, we can reconstruct visibility changes of objects. We further propose a decomposed color model for improved geometric consistency. GTM achieved state-of-the-art rendering fidelity on 3 datasets and is 100 times faster than NeRF-based counterparts in rendering. Moreover, GTM successfully disentangles the appearance changes and renders smooth appearance interpolation.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13694](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13694) |
| 172 | Lift-Attend-Splat: Bird's-eye-view camera-lidar fusion using transformers | James Gunn,Zygmunt Lenyk,Anuj Sharma,Andrea Donati,Alexandru Buburuzan,John Redford,Romain Mueller | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Combining complementary sensor modalities is crucial to providing robust perception for safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving (AD). Recent state-of-the-art camera-lidar fusion methods for AD rely on monocular depth estimation which is a notoriously difficult task compared to using depth information from the lidar directly. Here, we find that this approach does not leverage depth as expected and show that naively improving depth estimation does not lead to improvements in object detection performance. Strikingly, we also find that removing depth estimation altogether does not degrade object detection performance substantially, suggesting that relying on monocular depth could be an unnecessary architectural bottleneck during camera-lidar fusion. In this work, we introduce a novel fusion method that bypasses monocular depth estimation altogether and instead selects and fuses camera and lidar features in a bird's-eye-view grid using a simple attention mechanism. We show that our model can modulate its use of camera features based on the availability of lidar features and that it yields better 3D object detection on the nuScenes dataset than baselines relying on monocular depth estimation.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14919](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14919) |
| 171 | Gaussian Head & Shoulders: High Fidelity Neural Upper Body Avatars with Anchor Gaussian Guided Texture Warping | Tianhao Wu,Jing Yang,Zhilin Guo,Jingyi Wan,Fangcheng Zhong,Cengiz Oztireli | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>By equipping the most recent 3D Gaussian Splatting representation with head 3D morphable models (3DMM), existing methods manage to create head avatars with high fidelity. However, most existing methods only reconstruct a head without the body, substantially limiting their application scenarios. We found that naively applying Gaussians to model the clothed chest and shoulders tends to result in blurry reconstruction and noisy floaters under novel poses. This is because of the fundamental limitation of Gaussians and point clouds -- each Gaussian or point can only have a single directional radiance without spatial variance, therefore an unnecessarily large number of them is required to represent complicated spatially varying texture, even for simple geometry. In contrast, we propose to model the body part with a neural texture that consists of coarse and pose-dependent fine colors. To properly render the body texture for each view and pose without accurate geometry nor UV mapping, we optimize another sparse set of Gaussians as anchors that constrain the neural warping field that maps image plane coordinates to the texture space. We demonstrate that Gaussian Head & Shoulders can fit the high-frequency details on the clothed upper body with high fidelity and potentially improve the accuracy and fidelity of the head region. We evaluate our method with casual phone-captured and internet videos and show our method archives superior reconstruction quality and robustness in both self and cross reenactment tasks. To fully utilize the efficient rendering speed of Gaussian splatting, we additionally propose an accelerated inference method of our trained model without Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) queries and reach a stable rendering speed of around 130 FPS for any subjects.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12069](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12069) |
| 170 | LAGA: Layered 3D Avatar Generation and Customization via Gaussian Splatting | Jia Gong,Shenyu Ji,Lin Geng Foo,Kang Chen,Hossein Rahmani,Jun Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Creating and customizing a 3D clothed avatar from textual descriptions is a critical and challenging task. Traditional methods often treat the human body and clothing as inseparable, limiting users' ability to freely mix and match garments. In response to this limitation, we present LAyered Gaussian Avatar (LAGA), a carefully designed framework enabling the creation of high-fidelity decomposable avatars with diverse garments. By decoupling garments from avatar, our framework empowers users to conviniently edit avatars at the garment level. Our approach begins by modeling the avatar using a set of Gaussian points organized in a layered structure, where each layer corresponds to a specific garment or the human body itself. To generate high-quality garments for each layer, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy for diverse garment generation and a novel dual-SDS loss function to maintain coherence between the generated garments and avatar components, including the human body and other garments. Moreover, we introduce three regularization losses to guide the movement of Gaussians for garment transfer, allowing garments to be freely transferred to various avatars. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our approach surpasses existing methods in the generation of 3D clothed humans.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12663](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12663) |
| 169 | GSEdit: Efficient Text-Guided Editing of 3D Objects via Gaussian Splatting | Francesco Palandra,Andrea Sanchietti,Daniele Baieri,Emanuele Rodol\xc3\xa0 | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present GSEdit, a pipeline for text-guided 3D object editing based on Gaussian Splatting models. Our method enables the editing of the style and appearance of 3D objects without altering their main details, all in a matter of minutes on consumer hardware. We tackle the problem by leveraging Gaussian splatting to represent 3D scenes, and we optimize the model while progressively varying the image supervision by means of a pretrained image-based diffusion model. The input object may be given as a 3D triangular mesh, or directly provided as Gaussians from a generative model such as DreamGaussian. GSEdit ensures consistency across different viewpoints, maintaining the integrity of the original object's information. Compared to previously proposed methods relying on NeRF-like MLP models, GSEdit stands out for its efficiency, making 3D editing tasks much faster. Our editing process is refined via the application of the SDS loss, ensuring that our edits are both precise and accurate. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that GSEdit effectively alters object shape and appearance following the given textual instructions while preserving their coherence and detail.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05154](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05154) |
| 168 | GarmentDreamer: 3DGS Guided Garment Synthesis with Diverse Geometry and Texture Details | Boqian Li,Xuan Li,Ying Jiang,Tianyi Xie,Feng Gao,Huamin Wang,Yin Yang,Chenfanfu Jiang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Traditional 3D garment creation is labor-intensive, involving sketching, modeling, UV mapping, and texturing, which are time-consuming and costly. Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have enabled new possibilities for 3D garment generation from text prompts, images, and videos. However, existing methods either suffer from inconsistencies among multi-view images or require additional processes to separate cloth from the underlying human model. In this paper, we propose GarmentDreamer, a novel method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as guidance to generate wearable, simulation-ready 3D garment meshes from text prompts. In contrast to using multi-view images directly predicted by generative models as guidance, our 3DGS guidance ensures consistent optimization in both garment deformation and texture synthesis. Our method introduces a novel garment augmentation module, guided by normal and RGBA information, and employs implicit Neural Texture Fields (NeTF) combined with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to generate diverse geometric and texture details. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, showcasing the superior performance of GarmentDreamer over state-of-the-art alternatives.

However, it faces challenges in modeling mirror reflections, which exhibit substantial appearance variations from different viewpoints. To tackle this problem, we present MirrorGaussian, the first method for mirror scene reconstruction with real-time rendering based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. The key insight is grounded on the mirror symmetry between the real-world space and the virtual mirror space. We introduce an intuitive dual-rendering strategy that enables differentiable rasterization of both the real-world 3D Gaussians and the mirrored counterpart obtained by reflecting the former about the mirror plane. All 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized with the mirror plane in an end-to-end framework. MirrorGaussian achieves high-quality and real-time rendering in scenes with mirrors, empowering scene editing like adding new mirrors and objects. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

| 166 | Dreamer XL: Towards High-Resolution Text-to-3D Generation via Trajectory Score Matching | Xingyu Miao,Haoran Duan,Varun Ojha,Jun Song,Tejal Shah,Yang Long,Rajiv Ranjan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this work, we propose a novel Trajectory Score Matching (TSM) method that aims to solve the pseudo ground truth inconsistency problem caused by the accumulated error in Interval Score Matching (ISM) when using the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion process. Unlike ISM which adopts the inversion process of DDIM to calculate on a single path, our TSM method leverages the inversion process of DDIM to generate two paths from the same starting point for calculation. Since both paths start from the same starting point, TSM can reduce the accumulated error compared to ISM, thus alleviating the problem of pseudo ground truth inconsistency. TSM enhances the stability and consistency of the model's generated paths during the distillation process. We demonstrate this experimentally and further show that ISM is a special case of TSM. Furthermore, to optimize the current multi-stage optimization process from high-resolution text to 3D generation, we adopt Stable Diffusion XL for guidance. In response to the issues of abnormal replication and splitting caused by unstable gradients during the 3D Gaussian splatting process when using Stable Diffusion XL, we propose a pixel-by-pixel gradient clipping method. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of visual quality and performance.

| 165 | SAGD: Boundary-Enhanced Segment Anything in 3D Gaussian via Gaussian Decomposition | Xu Hu,Yuxi Wang,Lue Fan,Junsong Fan,Junran Peng,Zhen Lei,Qing Li,Zhaoxiang Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an alternative 3D representation for novel view synthesis, benefiting from its high-quality rendering results and real-time rendering speed. However, the 3D Gaussians learned by 3D-GS have ambiguous structures without any geometry constraints. This inherent issue in 3D-GS leads to a rough boundary when segmenting individual objects. To remedy these problems, we propose SAGD, a conceptually simple yet effective boundary-enhanced segmentation pipeline for 3D-GS to improve segmentation accuracy while preserving segmentation speed. Specifically, we introduce a Gaussian Decomposition scheme, which ingeniously utilizes the special structure of 3D Gaussian, finds out, and then decomposes the boundary Gaussians. Moreover, to achieve fast interactive 3D segmentation, we introduce a novel training-free pipeline by lifting a 2D foundation model to 3D-GS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality 3D segmentation without rough boundary issues, which can be easily applied to other scene editing tasks.</details> | January 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17857](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17857) |

Notably, this is also a novel form of tightly coupled map for LiDAR-visual-inertial sensor fusion.  This system leverages the complementary characteristics of LiDAR and visual data to capture the geometric structures of large-scale 3D scenes and restore their visual surface information with high fidelity. The initialization for the scene's surface Gaussians and the sensor's poses of each frame are obtained using a LiDAR-inertial system with the feature of size-adaptive voxels. Then, we optimized and refined the Gaussians using visual-derived photometric gradients to optimize their quality and density.

While the optimization can draw photometric reference from the input videos or be regulated by generative models, directly supervising Gaussian motions remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept, Gaussian flow, which connects the dynamics of 3D Gaussians and pixel velocities between consecutive frames. The Gaussian flow can be efficiently obtained by splatting Gaussian dynamics into the image space. This differentiable process enables direct dynamic supervision from optical flow. Our method significantly benefits 4D dynamic content generation and 4D novel view synthesis with Gaussian Splatting, especially for contents with rich motions that are hard to be handled by existing methods. The common color drifting issue that happens in 4D generation is also resolved with improved Guassian dynamics. Superior visual quality on extensive experiments demonstrates our method's effectiveness.

Both 2D and 3D diffusion models can help generate decent 3D objects based on prompts. 3D diffusion models have good 3D consistency, but their quality and generalization are limited as trainable 3D data is expensive and hard to obtain. 2D diffusion models enjoy strong abilities of generalization and fine generation, but 3D consistency is hard to guarantee. This paper attempts to bridge the power from the two types of diffusion models via the recent explicit and efficient 3D Gaussian splatting representation. A fast 3D object generation framework, named as GaussianDreamer, is proposed, where the 3D diffusion model provides priors for initialization and the 2D diffusion model enriches the geometry and appearance. Operations of noisy point growing and color perturbation are introduced to enhance the initialized Gaussians. Our GaussianDreamer can generate a high-quality 3D instance or 3D avatar within 15 minutes on one GPU, much faster than previous methods, while the generated instances can be directly rendered in real time.

A recent advance, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), leverages an explicit representation to achieve real-time rendering with high-quality results. However, 3DGS still requires an abundance of training views to generate a coherent scene representation. In few shot settings, similar to NeRF, 3DGS tends to overfit to training views, causing background collapse and excessive floaters, especially as the number of training views are reduced. We propose a method to enable training coherent 3DGS-based radiance fields of 360-degree scenes from sparse training views. We integrate depth priors with generative and explicit constraints to reduce background collapse, remove floaters, and enhance consistency from unseen viewpoints. Experiments show that our method outperforms base 3DGS by 6.4% in LPIPS and by 12.2% in PSNR, and NeRF-based methods by at least 17.6% in LPIPS on the MipNeRF-360 dataset with substantially less training and inference cost.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00206](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00206) |

The latest method, known as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), has set new benchmarks for rendering quality and speed. Nevertheless, the limitations of 3D-GS become pronounced in synthesizing new viewpoints, especially for views that greatly deviate from those seen during training. Additionally, issues such as dilation and aliasing arise when zooming in or out. These challenges can all be traced back to a single underlying issue: insufficient sampling. In our paper, we present a bootstrapping method that significantly addresses this problem. This approach employs a diffusion model to enhance the rendering of novel views using trained 3D-GS, thereby streamlining the training process. Our results indicate that bootstrapping effectively reduces artifacts, as well as clear enhancements on the evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we show that our method is versatile and can be easily integrated, allowing various 3D reconstruction projects to benefit from our approach.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18669](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18669) |

Gaussian Splatting has demonstrated its advantages in implicit 3D reconstruction, compared with the original Neural Radiance Fields. As the rapid development of technologies and principles, people tried to used the Stable Diffusion models to generate targeted models with text instructions. However, using the normal implicit machine learning methods is hard to gain the precise motions and actions control, further more, it is difficult to generate a long content and semantic continuous 3D video. To address this issue, we propose the OneTo3D, a method and theory to used one single image to generate the editable 3D model and generate the targeted semantic continuous time-unlimited 3D video. We used a normal basic Gaussian Splatting model to generate the 3D model from a single image, which requires less volume of video memory and computer calculation ability. Subsequently, we designed an automatic generation and self-adaptive binding mechanism for the object armature. Combined with the re-editable motions and actions analyzing and controlling algorithm we proposed, we can achieve a better performance than the SOTA projects in the area of building the 3D model precise motions and actions control, and generating a stable semantic continuous time-unlimited 3D video with the input text instructions.

Fast and high-fidelity scene generation is paramount for ensuring user-friendly experiences. However, existing methods are characterized by lengthy generation processes or necessitate the intricate manual specification of motion parameters, which introduces inconvenience for users. Furthermore, these methods often rely on narrow-field viewpoint iterative generations, compromising global consistency and overall scene quality. To address these issues, we propose FastScene, a framework for fast and higher-quality 3D scene generation, while maintaining the scene consistency. Specifically, given a text prompt, we generate a panorama and estimate its depth, since the panorama encompasses information about the entire scene and exhibits explicit geometric constraints. To obtain high-quality novel views, we introduce the Coarse View Synthesis (CVS) and Progressive Novel View Inpainting (PNVI) strategies, ensuring both scene consistency and view quality. Subsequently, we utilize Multi-View Projection (MVP) to form perspective views, and apply 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for scene reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate FastScene surpasses other methods in both generation speed and quality with better scene consistency. Notably, guided only by a text prompt, FastScene can generate a 3D scene within a mere 15 minutes, which is at least one hour faster than state-of-the-art methods, making it a paradigm for user-friendly scene generation.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05768](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05768) |
| 154 | RTG-SLAM: Real-time 3D Reconstruction at Scale using Gaussian Splatting | Zhexi Peng,Tianjia Shao,Yong Liu,Jingke Zhou,Yin Yang,Jingdong Wang,Kun Zhou | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present Real-time Gaussian SLAM (RTG-SLAM), a real-time 3D reconstruction system with an RGBD camera for large-scale environments using Gaussian splatting. The system features a compact Gaussian representation and a highly efficient on-the-fly Gaussian optimization scheme. We force each Gaussian to be either opaque or nearly transparent, with the opaque ones fitting the surface and dominant colors, and transparent ones fitting residual colors. By rendering depth in a different way from color rendering, we let a single opaque Gaussian well fit a local surface region without the need of multiple overlapping Gaussians, hence largely reducing the memory and computation cost. For on-the-fly Gaussian optimization, we explicitly add Gaussians for three types of pixels per frame: newly observed, with large color errors, and with large depth errors. We also categorize all Gaussians into stable and unstable ones, where the stable Gaussians are expected to well fit previously observed RGBD images and otherwise unstable. We only optimize the unstable Gaussians and only render the pixels occupied by unstable Gaussians. In this way, both the number of Gaussians to be optimized and pixels to be rendered are largely reduced, and the optimization can be done in real time. We show real-time reconstructions of a variety of large scenes. Compared with the state-of-the-art NeRF-based RGBD SLAM, our system achieves comparable high-quality reconstruction but with around twice the speed and half the memory cost, and shows superior performance in the realism of novel view synthesis and camera tracking accuracy.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19706](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19706) |
| 153 | GDGS: Gradient Domain Gaussian Splatting for Sparse Representation of Radiance Fields | Yuanhao Gong | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The 3D Gaussian splatting methods are getting popular. However, they work directly on the signal, leading to a dense representation of the signal. Even with some techniques such as pruning or distillation, the results are still dense. In this paper, we propose to model the gradient of the original signal. The gradients are much sparser than the original signal. Therefore, the gradients use much less Gaussian splats, leading to the more efficient storage and thus higher computational performance during both training and rendering. Thanks to the sparsity, during the view synthesis, only a small mount of pixels are needed, leading to much higher computational performance ($100\\sim 1000\\times$ faster). And the 2D image can be recovered from the gradients via solving a Poisson equation with linear computation complexity. Several experiments are performed to confirm the sparseness of the gradients and the computation performance of the proposed method. The method can be applied various applications, such as human body modeling and indoor environment modeling.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05446](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05446) |

| 151 | DeferredGS: Decoupled and Editable Gaussian Splatting with Deferred Shading | Tong Wu,Jia-Mu Sun,Yu-Kun Lai,Yuewen Ma,Leif Kobbelt,Lin Gao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing and editing 3D objects and scenes both play crucial roles in computer graphics and computer vision. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) can achieve realistic reconstruction and editing results but suffer from inefficiency in rendering. Gaussian splatting significantly accelerates rendering by rasterizing Gaussian ellipsoids. However, Gaussian splatting utilizes a single Spherical Harmonic (SH) function to model both texture and lighting, limiting independent editing capabilities of these components. Recently, attempts have been made to decouple texture and lighting with the Gaussian splatting representation but may fail to produce plausible geometry and decomposition results on reflective scenes. Additionally, the forward shading technique they employ introduces noticeable blending artifacts during relighting, as the geometry attributes of Gaussians are optimized under the original illumination and may not be suitable for novel lighting conditions. To address these issues, we introduce DeferredGS, a method for decoupling and editing the Gaussian splatting representation using deferred shading. To achieve successful decoupling, we model the illumination with a learnable environment map and define additional attributes such as texture parameters and normal direction on Gaussians, where the normal is distilled from a jointly trained signed distance function. More importantly, we apply deferred shading, resulting in more realistic relighting effects compared to previous methods. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DeferredGS in novel view synthesis and editing tasks.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09412](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09412) |

Unfortunately, traditional techniques for content creation, editing, and interaction within these virtual spaces are fraught with difficulties. They tend to be not only engineering-intensive but also require extensive expertise, which adds to the frustration and inefficiency in virtual object manipulation. Our proposed VR-GS system represents a leap forward in human-centered 3D content interaction, offering a seamless and intuitive user experience. By developing a physical dynamics-aware interactive Gaussian Splatting in a Virtual Reality setting, and constructing a highly efficient two-level embedding strategy alongside deformable body simulations, VR-GS ensures real-time execution with highly realistic dynamic responses. The components of our Virtual Reality system are designed for high efficiency and effectiveness, starting from detailed scene reconstruction and object segmentation, advancing through multi-view image in-painting, and extending to interactive physics-based editing.

| 149 | FMGS: Foundation Model Embedded 3D Gaussian Splatting for Holistic 3D Scene Understanding | Xingxing Zuo,Pouya Samangouei,Yunwen Zhou,Yan Di,Mingyang Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Precisely perceiving the geometric and semantic properties of real-world 3D objects is crucial for the continued evolution of augmented reality and robotic applications. To this end, we present Foundation Model Embedded Gaussian Splatting (FMGS), which incorporates vision-language embeddings of foundation models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS). The key contribution of this work is an efficient method to reconstruct and represent 3D vision-language models. This is achieved by distilling feature maps generated from image-based foundation models into those rendered from our 3D model. To ensure high-quality rendering and fast training, we introduce a novel scene representation by integrating strengths from both GS and multi-resolution hash encodings (MHE). Our effective training procedure also introduces a pixel alignment loss that makes the rendered feature distance of the same semantic entities close, following the pixel-level semantic boundaries. Our results demonstrate remarkable multi-view semantic consistency, facilitating diverse downstream tasks, beating state-of-the-art methods by 10.2 percent on open-vocabulary language-based object detection, despite that we are 851X faster for inference. This research explores the intersection of vision, language, and 3D scene representation, paving the way for enhanced scene understanding in uncontrolled real-world environments.

Among these, 3D Gaussian Splatting stands out for its explicit representation of scenes using 3D Gaussians, making it appealing for tasks like 3D point cloud extraction and surface reconstruction. Motivated by its potential, we address the domain of 3D scene reconstruction, aiming to leverage the capabilities of the Microsoft HoloLens 2 for instant 3D Gaussian Splatting. We present HoloGS, a novel workflow utilizing HoloLens sensor data, which bypasses the need for pre-processing steps like Structure from Motion by instantly accessing the required input data i.e. the images, camera poses and the point cloud from depth sensing. We provide comprehensive investigations, including the training process and the rendering quality, assessed through the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, and the geometric 3D accuracy of the densified point cloud from Gaussian centers, measured by Chamfer Distance. We evaluate our approach on two self-captured scenes: An outdoor scene of a cultural heritage statue and an indoor scene of a fine-structured plant. Our results show that the HoloLens data, including RGB images, corresponding camera poses, and depth sensing based point clouds to initialize the Gaussians, are suitable as input for 3D Gaussian Splatting.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02005](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02005) |
| 147 | Compact 3D Scene Representation via Self-Organizing Gaussian Grids | Wieland Morgenstern,Florian Barthel,Anna Hilsmann,Peter Eisert | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as a highly promising technique for modeling of static 3D scenes. In contrast to Neural Radiance Fields, it utilizes efficient rasterization allowing for very fast rendering at high-quality. However, the storage size is significantly higher, which hinders practical deployment, e.g. on resource constrained devices. In this paper, we introduce a compact scene representation organizing the parameters of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into a 2D grid with local homogeneity, ensuring a drastic reduction in storage requirements without compromising visual quality during rendering. Central to our idea is the explicit exploitation of perceptual redundancies present in natural scenes. In essence, the inherent nature of a scene allows for numerous permutations of Gaussian parameters to equivalently represent it. To this end, we propose a novel highly parallel algorithm that regularly arranges the high-dimensional Gaussian parameters into a 2D grid while preserving their neighborhood structure. During training, we further enforce local smoothness between the sorted parameters in the grid. The uncompressed Gaussians use the same structure as 3DGS, ensuring a seamless integration with established renderers. Our method achieves a reduction factor of 17x to 42x in size for complex scenes with no increase in training time, marking a substantial leap forward in the domain of 3D scene distribution and consumption.

| 146 | 3D Gaussian Blendshapes for Head Avatar Animation | Shengjie Ma,Yanlin Weng,Tianjia Shao,Kun Zhou | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce 3D Gaussian blendshapes for modeling photorealistic head avatars. Taking a monocular video as input, we learn a base head model of neutral expression, along with a group of expression blendshapes, each of which corresponds to a basis expression in classical parametric face models. Both the neutral model and expression blendshapes are represented as 3D Gaussians, which contain a few properties to depict the avatar appearance. The avatar model of an arbitrary expression can be effectively generated by combining the neutral model and expression blendshapes through linear blending of Gaussians with the expression coefficients. High-fidelity head avatar animations can be synthesized in real time using Gaussian splatting. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our Gaussian blendshape representation better captures high-frequency details exhibited in input video, and achieves superior rendering performance.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19398](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19398) |
| 145 | Spectrally Pruned Gaussian Fields with Neural Compensation | Runyi Yang,Zhenxin Zhu,Zhou Jiang,Baijun Ye,Xiaoxue Chen,Yifei Zhang,Yuantao Chen,Jian Zhao,Hao Zhao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting, as a novel 3D representation, has garnered attention for its fast rendering speed and high rendering quality. However, this comes with high memory consumption, e.g., a well-trained Gaussian field may utilize three million Gaussian primitives and over 700 MB of memory. We credit this high memory footprint to the lack of consideration for the relationship between primitives. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient Gaussian field named SUNDAE with spectral pruning and neural compensation. On one hand, we construct a graph on the set of Gaussian primitives to model their relationship and design a spectral down-sampling module to prune out primitives while preserving desired signals. On the other hand, to compensate for the quality loss of pruning Gaussians, we exploit a lightweight neural network head to mix splatted features, which effectively compensates for quality losses while capturing the relationship between primitives in its weights. We demonstrate the performance of SUNDAE with extensive results. For example, SUNDAE can achieve 26.80 PSNR at 145 FPS using 104 MB memory while the vanilla Gaussian splatting algorithm achieves 25.60 PSNR at 160 FPS using 523 MB memory, on the Mip-NeRF360 dataset.

| 144 | GS-LRM: Large Reconstruction Model for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Kai Zhang,Sai Bi,Hao Tan,Yuanbo Xiangli,Nanxuan Zhao,Kalyan Sunkavalli,Zexiang Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose GS-LRM, a scalable large reconstruction model that can predict high-quality 3D Gaussian primitives from 2-4 posed sparse images in 0.23 seconds on single A100 GPU. Our model features a very simple transformer-based architecture; we patchify input posed images, pass the concatenated multi-view image tokens through a sequence of transformer blocks, and decode final per-pixel Gaussian parameters directly from these tokens for differentiable rendering. In contrast to previous LRMs that can only reconstruct objects, by predicting per-pixel Gaussians, GS-LRM naturally handles scenes with large variations in scale and complexity. We show that our model can work on both object and scene captures by training it on Objaverse and RealEstate10K respectively. In both scenarios, the models outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a wide margin. We also demonstrate applications of our model in downstream 3D generation tasks.

| 143 | SAGS: Structure-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting | Evangelos Ververas,Rolandos Alexandros Potamias,Jifei Song,Jiankang Deng,Stefanos Zafeiriou | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Following the advent of NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has paved the way to real-time neural rendering overcoming the computational burden of volumetric methods. Following the pioneering work of 3D-GS, several methods have attempted to achieve compressible and high-fidelity performance alternatives. However, by employing a geometry-agnostic optimization scheme, these methods neglect the inherent 3D structure of the scene, thereby restricting the expressivity and the quality of the representation, resulting in various floating points and artifacts. In this work, we propose a structure-aware Gaussian Splatting method (SAGS) that implicitly encodes the geometry of the scene, which reflects to state-of-the-art rendering performance and reduced storage requirements on benchmark novel-view synthesis datasets. SAGS is founded on a local-global graph representation that facilitates the learning of complex scenes and enforces meaningful point displacements that preserve the scene's geometry. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight version of SAGS, using a simple yet effective mid-point interpolation scheme, which showcases a compact representation of the scene with up to 24$\\times$ size reduction without the reliance on any compression strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of SAGS compared to state-of-the-art 3D-GS methods under both rendering quality and model size. Besides, we demonstrate that our structure-aware method can effectively mitigate floating artifacts and irregular distortions of previous methods while obtaining precise depth maps.

Specifically, GSTalker learns an audio-driven Gaussian deformation field to translate and transform 3D Gaussians to synchronize with audio information, in which multi-resolution hashing grid-based tri-plane and temporal smooth module are incorporated to learn accurate deformation for fine-grained facial details. In addition, a pose-conditioned deformation field is designed to model the stabilized torso. To enable efficient optimization of the condition Gaussian deformation field, we initialize 3D Gaussians by learning a coarse static Gaussian representation.

| 141 | MeGA: Hybrid Mesh-Gaussian Head Avatar for High-Fidelity Rendering and Head Editing | Cong Wang,Di Kang,He-Yi Sun,Shen-Han Qian,Zi-Xuan Wang,Linchao Bao,Song-Hai Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Creating high-fidelity head avatars from multi-view videos is a core issue for many AR/VR applications. However, existing methods usually struggle to obtain high-quality renderings for all different head components simultaneously since they use one single representation to model components with drastically different characteristics (e.g., skin vs. hair). In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Mesh-Gaussian Head Avatar (MeGA) that models different head components with more suitable representations. Specifically, we select an enhanced FLAME mesh as our facial representation and predict a UV displacement map to provide per-vertex offsets for improved personalized geometric details. To achieve photorealistic renderings, we obtain facial colors using deferred neural rendering and disentangle neural textures into three meaningful parts. For hair modeling, we first build a static canonical hair using 3D Gaussian Splatting. A rigid transformation and an MLP-based deformation field are further applied to handle complex dynamic expressions. Combined with our occlusion-aware blending, MeGA generates higher-fidelity renderings for the whole head and naturally supports more downstream tasks. Experiments on the NeRSemble dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our designs, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods and supporting various editing functionalities, including hairstyle alteration and texture editing.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19026) |

The video data obtained from these telescopes differ significantly from data for standard 3D reconstruction tasks, characterized by intense motion blur, atmospheric turbulence, pervasive background light pollution, extended focal length and constrained observational perspectives. To address these challenges, our approach begins with a comprehensive pre-processing workflow that encompasses deep learning-based image restoration, feature point extraction and camera pose initialization. We proceed with the application of an improved 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm for reconstructing the 3D model. Our technique supports simultaneous 3D Gaussian training and pose estimation, enabling the robust generation of intricate 3D point clouds from sparse, noisy data. The procedure is further bolstered by a post-editing phase designed to eliminate noise points inconsistent with our prior knowledge of a satellite's geometric constraints. We validate our approach using both synthetic datasets and actual observations of China's Space Station, showcasing its significant advantages over existing methods in reconstructing 3D space objects from ground-based observations.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18394](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18394) |

Splat-Nav consists of two components: 1) Splat-Plan, a safe planning module, and 2) Splat-Loc, a robust pose estimation module. Splat-Plan builds a safe-by-construction polytope corridor through the map based on mathematically rigorous collision constraints and then constructs a B\xc3\xa9zier curve trajectory through this corridor. Splat-Loc provides a robust state estimation module, leveraging the point-cloud representation inherent in GSplat scenes for global pose initialization, in the absence of prior knowledge, and recursive real-time pose localization, given only RGB images. The most compute-intensive procedures in our navigation pipeline, such as the computation of the B\xc3\xa9zier trajectories and the pose optimization problem run primarily on the CPU, freeing up GPU resources for GPU-intensive tasks, such as online training of Gaussian Splats. We demonstrate the safety and robustness of our pipeline in both simulation and hardware experiments, where we show online re-planning at 5 Hz and pose estimation at about 25 Hz, an order of magnitude faster than Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based navigation methods, thereby enabling real-time navigation.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02751](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02751) |

Meanwhile, large scale applications aiming at the data collection in complex environments like factory halls or construction sites are becoming feasible. However, in contrast to small scale scenarios with building interiors separated to single rooms, shop floors or construction areas require measures at larger distances in potentially texture less areas under difficult illumination. Pose estimation is further aggravated since no GNSS measures are available as it is usual for such indoor applications. In our work, we realize data collection in a large factory hall by a robot system equipped with four stereo cameras as well as a 3D laser scanner. We apply our state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM approaches and discuss the respective pros and cons of the different sensor types for trajectory estimation and dense map generation in such an environment.

However, fall short of achieving precise user control, often yielding results that do not align with user expectations, thus limiting their applicability. User-envisioning 3D object generation faces significant challenges in realizing its concepts using current generative models due to limited interaction capabilities. Existing methods mainly offer two approaches: (i) interpreting textual instructions with constrained controllability, or (ii) reconstructing 3D objects from 2D images. Both of them limit customization to the confines of the 2D reference and potentially introduce undesirable artifacts during the 3D lifting process, restricting the scope for direct and versatile 3D modifications. In this work, we introduce Interactive3D, an innovative framework for interactive 3D generation that grants users precise control over the generative process through extensive 3D interaction capabilities. Interactive3D is constructed in two cascading stages, utilizing distinct 3D representations. The first stage employs Gaussian Splatting for direct user interaction, allowing modifications and guidance of the generative direction at any intermediate step through (i) Adding and Removing components, (ii) Deformable and Rigid Dragging, (iii) Geometric Transformations, and (iv) Semantic Editing. Subsequently, the Gaussian splats are transformed into InstantNGP. We introduce a novel (v) Interactive Hash Refinement module to further add details and extract the geometry in the second stage. Our experiments demonstrate that Interactive3D markedly improves the controllability and quality of 3D generation.

It leverages the fast rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) while addressing the challenges of directly controlling 3DGS with speech audio. GaussianTalker constructs a canonical 3DGS representation of the head and deforms it in sync with the audio. A key insight is to encode the 3D Gaussian attributes into a shared implicit feature representation, where it is merged with audio features to manipulate each Gaussian attribute. This design exploits the spatial-aware features and enforces interactions between neighboring points. The feature embeddings are then fed to a spatial-audio attention module, which predicts frame-wise offsets for the attributes of each Gaussian. It is more stable than previous concatenation or multiplication approaches for manipulating the numerous Gaussians and their intricate parameters. Experimental results showcase GaussianTalker's superiority in facial fidelity, lip synchronization accuracy, and rendering speed compared to previous methods. Specifically, GaussianTalker achieves a remarkable rendering speed up to 120 FPS, surpassing previous benchmarks.

However, existing methods still lack accurate control of the specified appearance and location of the editing result due to the inherent limitations of the text description. To this end, we propose a 3D scene editing framework, TIPEditor, that accepts both text and image prompts and a 3D bounding box to specify the editing region. With the image prompt, users can conveniently specify the detailed appearance/style of the target content in complement to the text description, enabling accurate control of the appearance. Specifically, TIP-Editor employs a stepwise 2D personalization strategy to better learn the representation of the existing scene and the reference image, in which a localization loss is proposed to encourage correct object placement as specified by the bounding box. Additionally, TIPEditor utilizes explicit and flexible 3D Gaussian splatting as the 3D representation to facilitate local editing while keeping the background unchanged. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that TIP-Editor conducts accurate editing following the text and image prompts in the specified bounding box region, consistently outperforming the baselines in editing quality, and the alignment to the prompts, qualitatively and quantitatively.</details> | January 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14828](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14828) |

We circumvent the problem by leveraging deep learning methods trained on billions of images. We propose a method to reconstruct point clouds from few images and to denoise point clouds from their rendering by exploiting prior knowledge distilled from image-based deep learning models. To improve reconstruction in constraint settings, we regularize the training of a differentiable renderer with hybrid surface and appearance by introducing semantic consistency supervision. In addition, we propose a pipeline to finetune Stable Diffusion to denoise renderings of noisy point clouds and we demonstrate how these learned filters can be used to remove point cloud noise coming without 3D supervision. We compare our method with DSS and PointRadiance and achieved higher quality 3D reconstruction on the Sketchfab Testset and SCUT Dataset.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01112](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01112) |
| 132 | Guess The Unseen: Dynamic 3D Scene Reconstruction from Partial 2D Glimpses | Inhee Lee,Byungjun Kim,Hanbyul Joo | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we present a method to reconstruct the world and multiple dynamic humans in 3D from a monocular video input. As a key idea, we represent both the world and multiple humans via the recently emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) representation, enabling to conveniently and efficiently compose and render them together. In particular, we address the scenarios with severely limited and sparse observations in 3D human reconstruction, a common challenge encountered in the real world. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach to optimize the 3D-GS representation in a canonical space by fusing the sparse cues in the common space, where we leverage a pre-trained 2D diffusion model to synthesize unseen views while keeping the consistency with the observed 2D appearances. We demonstrate our method can reconstruct high-quality animatable 3D humans in various challenging examples, in the presence of occlusion, image crops, few-shot, and extremely sparse observations. After reconstruction, our method is capable of not only rendering the scene in any novel views at arbitrary time instances, but also editing the 3D scene by removing individual humans or applying different motions for each human. Through various experiments, we demonstrate the quality and efficiency of our methods over alternative existing approaches.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14410](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14410) |
| 131 | Dynamic Gaussians Mesh: Consistent Mesh Reconstruction from Monocular Videos | Isabella Liu,Hao Su,Xiaolong Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Modern 3D engines and graphics pipelines require mesh as a memory-efficient representation, which allows efficient rendering, geometry processing, texture editing, and many other downstream operations. However, it is still highly difficult to obtain high-quality mesh in terms of structure and detail from monocular visual observations. The problem becomes even more challenging for dynamic scenes and objects. To this end, we introduce Dynamic Gaussians Mesh (DG-Mesh), a framework to reconstruct a high-fidelity and time-consistent mesh given a single monocular video. Our work leverages the recent advancement in 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct the mesh sequence with temporal consistency from a video. Building on top of this representation, DG-Mesh recovers high-quality meshes from the Gaussian points and can track the mesh vertices over time, which enables applications such as texture editing on dynamic objects. We introduce the Gaussian-Mesh Anchoring, which encourages evenly distributed Gaussians, resulting better mesh reconstruction through mesh-guided densification and pruning on the deformed Gaussians. By applying cycle-consistent deformation between the canonical and the deformed space, we can project the anchored Gaussian back to the canonical space and optimize Gaussians across all time frames. During the evaluation on different datasets, DG-Mesh provides significantly better mesh reconstruction and rendering than baselines.

Jeni | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Capturing and re-animating the 3D structure of articulated objects present significant barriers. On one hand, methods requiring extensively calibrated multi-view setups are prohibitively complex and resource-intensive, limiting their practical applicability. On the other hand, while single-camera Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) offer a more streamlined approach, they have excessive training and rendering costs. 3D Gaussian Splatting would be a suitable alternative but for two reasons. Firstly, existing methods for 3D dynamic Gaussians require synchronized multi-view cameras, and secondly, the lack of controllability in dynamic scenarios. We present CoGS, a method for Controllable Gaussian Splatting, that enables the direct manipulation of scene elements, offering real-time control of dynamic scenes without the prerequisite of pre-computing control signals. We evaluated CoGS using both synthetic and real-world datasets that include dynamic objects that differ in degree of difficulty. In our evaluations, CoGS consistently outperformed existing dynamic and controllable neural representations in terms of visual fidelity.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05664](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05664) |
| 129 | CLIP-GS: CLIP-Informed Gaussian Splatting for Real-time and View-consistent 3D Semantic Understanding | Guibiao Liao,Jiankun Li,Zhenyu Bao,Xiaoqing Ye,Jingdong Wang,Qing Li,Kanglin Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) exhibits high-quality and real-time synthesis of novel views in 3D scenes. Currently, it primarily focuses on geometry and appearance modeling, while lacking the semantic understanding of scenes. To bridge this gap, we present CLIP-GS, which integrates semantics from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) into Gaussian Splatting to efficiently comprehend 3D environments without annotated semantic data. In specific, rather than straightforwardly learning and rendering high-dimensional semantic features of 3D Gaussians, which significantly diminishes the efficiency, we propose a Semantic Attribute Compactness (SAC) approach. SAC exploits the inherent unified semantics within objects to learn compact yet effective semantic representations of 3D Gaussians, enabling highly efficient rendering (>100 FPS). Additionally, to address the semantic ambiguity, caused by utilizing view-inconsistent 2D CLIP semantics to supervise Gaussians, we introduce a 3D Coherent Self-training (3DCS) strategy, resorting to the multi-view consistency originated from the 3D model. 3DCS imposes cross-view semantic consistency constraints by leveraging refined, self-predicted pseudo-labels derived from the trained 3D Gaussian model, thereby enhancing precise and view-consistent segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method remarkably outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvements of 17.29% and 20.81% in mIoU metric on Replica and ScanNet datasets, respectively, while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior performance even with sparse input data, verifying the robustness of our method.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14249](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14249) |
| 128 | EGGS: Edge Guided Gaussian Splatting for Radiance Fields | Yuanhao Gong | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The Gaussian splatting methods are getting popular. However, their loss function only contains the $\\ell_1$ norm and the structural similarity between the rendered and input images, without considering the edges in these images. It is well-known that the edges in an image provide important information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Edge Guided Gaussian Splatting (EGGS) method that leverages the edges in the input images. More specifically, we give the edge region a higher weight than the flat region. With such edge guidance, the resulting Gaussian particles focus more on the edges instead of the flat regions. Moreover, such edge guidance does not crease the computation cost during the training and rendering stage. The experiments confirm that such simple edge-weighted loss function indeed improves about $1\\sim2$ dB on several difference data sets. With simply plugging in the edge guidance, the proposed method can improve all Gaussian splatting methods in different scenarios, such as human head modeling, building 3D reconstruction, etc.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09105](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09105) |
| 127 | GScream: Learning 3D Geometry and Feature Consistent Gaussian Splatting for Object Removal | Yuxin Wang,Qianyi Wu,Guofeng Zhang,Dan Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper tackles the intricate challenge of object removal to update the radiance field using the 3D Gaussian Splatting. The main challenges of this task lie in the preservation of geometric consistency and the maintenance of texture coherence in the presence of the substantial discrete nature of Gaussian primitives. We introduce a robust framework specifically designed to overcome these obstacles. The key insight of our approach is the enhancement of information exchange among visible and invisible areas, facilitating content restoration in terms of both geometry and texture. Our methodology begins with optimizing the positioning of Gaussian primitives to improve geometric consistency across both removed and visible areas, guided by an online registration process informed by monocular depth estimation. Following this, we employ a novel feature propagation mechanism to bolster texture coherence, leveraging a cross-attention design that bridges sampling Gaussians from both uncertain and certain areas. This innovative approach significantly refines the texture coherence within the final radiance field. Extensive experiments validate that our method not only elevates the quality of novel view synthesis for scenes undergoing object removal but also showcases notable efficiency gains in training and rendering speeds.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13679](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13679) |

However, to the best of our knowledge, the research on 3D talking face does not go deeper as 2D talking face, in the aspect of lip-synchronization (lip-sync) and speech perception. To mind the gap between the two sub-fields, we propose a learning framework named Learn2Talk, which can construct a better 3D talking face network by exploiting two expertise points from the field of 2D talking face. Firstly, inspired by the audio-video sync network, a 3D sync-lip expert model is devised for the pursuit of lip-sync between audio and 3D facial motion. Secondly, a teacher model selected from 2D talking face methods is used to guide the training of the audio-to-3D motions regression network to yield more 3D vertex accuracy. Extensive experiments show the advantages of the proposed framework in terms of lip-sync, vertex accuracy and speech perception, compared with state-of-the-arts. Finally, we show two applications of the proposed framework: audio-visual speech recognition and speech-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting based avatar animation.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12888](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12888) |
| 125 | EfficientGS: Streamlining Gaussian Splatting for Large-Scale High-Resolution Scene Representation | Wenkai Liu,Tao Guan,Bin Zhu,Lili Ju,Zikai Song,Dan Li,Yuesong Wang,Wei Yang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In the domain of 3D scene representation, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technology. However, its application to large-scale, high-resolution scenes (exceeding 4k$\\times$4k pixels) is hindered by the excessive computational requirements for managing a large number of Gaussians. Addressing this, we introduce 'EfficientGS', an advanced approach that optimizes 3DGS for high-resolution, large-scale scenes. We analyze the densification process in 3DGS and identify areas of Gaussian over-proliferation. We propose a selective strategy, limiting Gaussian increase to key primitives, thereby enhancing the representational efficiency. Additionally, we develop a pruning mechanism to remove redundant Gaussians, those that are merely auxiliary to adjacent ones. For further enhancement, we integrate a sparse order increment for Spherical Harmonics (SH), designed to alleviate storage constraints and reduce training overhead. Our empirical evaluations, conducted on a range of datasets including extensive 4K+ aerial images, demonstrate that 'EfficientGS' not only expedites training and rendering times but also achieves this with a model size approximately tenfold smaller than conventional 3DGS while maintaining high rendering fidelity.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12777](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12777) |
| 124 | DeblurGS: Gaussian Splatting for Camera Motion Blur | Jeongtaek Oh,Jaeyoung Chung,Dongwoo Lee,Kyoung Mu Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Although significant progress has been made in reconstructing sharp 3D scenes from motion-blurred images, a transition to real-world applications remains challenging. The primary obstacle stems from the severe blur which leads to inaccuracies in the acquisition of initial camera poses through Structure-from-Motion, a critical aspect often overlooked by previous approaches. To address this challenge, we propose DeblurGS, a method to optimize sharp 3D Gaussian Splatting from motion-blurred images, even with the noisy camera pose initialization. We restore a fine-grained sharp scene by leveraging the remarkable reconstruction capability of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach estimates the 6-Degree-of-Freedom camera motion for each blurry observation and synthesizes corresponding blurry renderings for the optimization process. Furthermore, we propose Gaussian Densification Annealing strategy to prevent the generation of inaccurate Gaussians at erroneous locations during the early training stages when camera motion is still imprecise. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our DeblurGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in deblurring and novel view synthesis for real-world and synthetic benchmark datasets, as well as field-captured blurry smartphone videos.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11358](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11358) |
| 123 | Distance and Collision Probability Estimation from Gaussian Surface Models | Kshitij Goel,Wennie Tabib | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper describes continuous-space methodologies to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient between an ellipsoidal robot model and an environment surface modeled as a set of Gaussian distributions. Continuous-space collision probability estimation is critical for uncertainty-aware motion planning. Most collision detection and avoidance approaches assume the robot is modeled as a sphere, but ellipsoidal representations provide tighter approximations and enable navigation in cluttered and narrow spaces. State-of-the-art methods derive the Euclidean distance and gradient by processing raw point clouds, which is computationally expensive for large workspaces. Recent advances in Gaussian surface modeling (e.g. mixture models, splatting) enable compressed and high-fidelity surface representations. Few methods exist to estimate continuous-space occupancy from such models. They require Gaussians to model free space and are unable to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient for an ellipsoidal robot. The proposed methods bridge this gap by extending prior work in ellipsoid-to-ellipsoid Euclidean distance and collision probability estimation to Gaussian surface models. A geometric blending approach is also proposed to improve collision probability estimation. The approaches are evaluated with numerical 2D and 3D experiments using real-world point cloud data. Methods for efficient calculation of these quantities are demonstrated to execute within a few microseconds per ellipsoid pair using a single-thread on low-power CPUs of modern embedded computers</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00186](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00186) |
| 122 | RainyScape: Unsupervised Rainy Scene Reconstruction using Decoupled Neural Rendering | Xianqiang Lyu,Hui Liu,Junhui Hou | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose RainyScape, an unsupervised framework for reconstructing clean scenes from a collection of multi-view rainy images. RainyScape consists of two main modules: a neural rendering module and a rain-prediction module that incorporates a predictor network and a learnable latent embedding that captures the rain characteristics of the scene. Specifically, based on the spectral bias property of neural networks, we first optimize the neural rendering pipeline to obtain a low-frequency scene representation. Subsequently, we jointly optimize the two modules, driven by the proposed adaptive direction-sensitive gradient-based reconstruction loss, which encourages the network to distinguish between scene details and rain streaks, facilitating the propagation of gradients to the relevant components. Extensive experiments on both the classic neural radiance field and the recently proposed 3D Gaussian splatting demonstrate the superiority of our method in effectively eliminating rain streaks and rendering clean images, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Splatter Image is based on Gaussian Splatting, which allows fast and high-quality reconstruction of 3D scenes from multiple images. We apply Gaussian Splatting to monocular reconstruction by learning a neural network that, at test time, performs reconstruction in a feed-forward manner, at 38 FPS. Our main innovation is the surprisingly straightforward design of this network, which, using 2D operators, maps the input image to one 3D Gaussian per pixel. The resulting set of Gaussians thus has the form an image, the Splatter Image. We further extend the method take several images as input via cross-view attention. Owning to the speed of the renderer (588 FPS), we use a single GPU for training while generating entire images at each iteration to optimize perceptual metrics like LPIPS. On several synthetic, real, multi-category and large-scale benchmark datasets, we achieve better results in terms of PSNR, LPIPS, and other metrics while training and evaluating much faster than prior works.

However, current methods are often hampered by the non-volumetric or implicit way they represent a scene. This work introduces SplaTAM, an approach that, for the first time, leverages explicit volumetric representations, i.e., 3D Gaussians, to enable high-fidelity reconstruction from a single unposed RGB-D camera, surpassing the capabilities of existing methods. SplaTAM employs a simple online tracking and mapping system tailored to the underlying Gaussian representation. It utilizes a silhouette mask to elegantly capture the presence of scene density. This combination enables several benefits over prior representations, including fast rendering and dense optimization, quickly determining if areas have been previously mapped, and structured map expansion by adding more Gaussians.

However, the majority of videos generated by recent works lack depth information and are confined to the constraints of 2D image space. In this paper, inspired by significant progress in the field of novel view synthesis (NVS) achieved by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), we propose LoopGaussian to elevate cinemagraph from 2D image space to 3D space using 3D Gaussian modeling. To achieve this, we first employ the 3D-GS method to reconstruct 3D Gaussian point clouds from multi-view images of static scenes,incorporating shape regularization terms to prevent blurring or artifacts caused by object deformation. We then adopt an autoencoder tailored for 3D Gaussian to project it into feature space. To maintain the local continuity of the scene, we devise SuperGaussian for clustering based on the acquired features. By calculating the similarity between clusters and employing a two-stage estimation method, we derive an Eulerian motion field to describe velocities across the entire scene. The 3D Gaussian points then move within the estimated Eulerian motion field. Through bidirectional animation techniques, we ultimately generate a 3D Cinemagraph that exhibits natural and seamlessly loopable dynamics. Experiment results validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating high-quality and visually appealing scene generation.

However, due to the flaw of its adaptive density control strategy in 3D-GS, it frequently suffers from over-reconstruction issue in intricate scenes containing high-frequency details, leading to blurry rendered images. The underlying reason for the flaw has still been under-explored. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the cause of aforementioned artifacts, namely gradient collision, which prevents large Gaussians in over-reconstructed regions from splitting. To address this issue, we propose the novel homodirectional view-space positional gradient as the criterion for densification. Our strategy efficiently identifies large Gaussians in over-reconstructed regions, and recovers fine details by splitting. We evaluate our proposed method on various challenging datasets. The experimental results indicate that our approach achieves the best rendering quality with reduced or similar memory consumption.

While recent advances in neural implicit rendering have unlocked unprecedented photorealism for digital avatars, real-time performance has mostly been demonstrated for static scenes only. To address this, we propose ASH, an animatable Gaussian splatting approach for photorealistic rendering of dynamic humans in real-time. We parameterize the clothed human as animatable 3D Gaussians, which can be efficiently splatted into image space to generate the final rendering. However, naively learning the Gaussian parameters in 3D space poses a severe challenge in terms of compute. Instead, we attach the Gaussians onto a deformable character model, and learn their parameters in 2D texture space, which allows leveraging efficient 2D convolutional architectures that easily scale with the required number of Gaussians. We benchmark ASH with competing methods on pose-controllable avatars, demonstrating that our method outperforms existing real-time methods by a large margin and shows comparable or even better results than offline methods.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05941](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05941) |

However, the substantial data volume of Gaussian splatting impedes its practical utility in real-world applications. Herein, we propose an efficient 3D scene representation, named Compressed Gaussian Splatting (CompGS), which harnesses compact Gaussian primitives for faithful 3D scene modeling with a remarkably reduced data size. To ensure the compactness of Gaussian primitives, we devise a hybrid primitive structure that captures predictive relationships between each other. Then, we exploit a small set of anchor primitives for prediction, allowing the majority of primitives to be encapsulated into highly compact residual forms. Moreover, we develop a rate-constrained optimization scheme to eliminate redundancies within such hybrid primitives, steering our CompGS towards an optimal trade-off between bitrate consumption and representation efficacy. Experimental results show that the proposed CompGS significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior compactness in 3D scene representation without compromising model accuracy and rendering quality.

Most methods assume the people is in an unobstructed scene, while various objects may cause the occlusion of body parts in real-life scenarios. Previous method utilizing NeRF for surface rendering to recover the occluded areas, but it requiring more than one day to train and several seconds to render, failing to meet the requirements of real-time interactive applications. To address these issues, we propose OccGaussian based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which can be trained within 6 minutes and produces high-quality human renderings up to 160 FPS with occluded input. OccGaussian initializes 3D Gaussian distributions in the canonical space, and we perform occlusion feature query at occluded regions, the aggregated pixel-align feature is extracted to compensate for the missing information. Then we use Gaussian Feature MLP to further process the feature along with the occlusion-aware loss functions to better perceive the occluded area.

Our method, which runs live at 3fps, utilises Gaussians as the only 3D representation, unifying the required representation for accurate, efficient tracking, mapping, and high-quality rendering. Designed for challenging monocular settings, our approach is seamlessly extendable to RGB-D SLAM when an external depth sensor is available. Several innovations are required to continuously reconstruct 3D scenes with high fidelity from a live camera. First, to move beyond the original 3DGS algorithm, which requires accurate poses from an offline Structure from Motion (SfM) system, we formulate camera tracking for 3DGS using direct optimisation against the 3D Gaussians, and show that this enables fast and robust tracking with a wide basin of convergence. Second, by utilising the explicit nature of the Gaussians, we introduce geometric verification and regularisation to handle the ambiguities occurring in incremental 3D dense reconstruction.

Nevertheless, generating 3D scenes characterized by multiple instances and intricate arrangements remains challenging. In this study, we present DreamScape, a method for creating highly consistent 3D scenes solely from textual descriptions, leveraging the strong 3D representation capabilities of Gaussian Splatting and the complex arrangement abilities of large language models (LLMs). Our approach involves a 3D Gaussian Guide ($3{DG^2}$) for scene representation, consisting of semantic primitives (objects) and their spatial transformations and relationships derived directly from text prompts using LLMs. This compositional representation allows for local-to-global optimization of the entire scene. A progressive scale control is tailored during local object generation, ensuring that objects of different sizes and densities adapt to the scene, which addresses training instability issue arising from simple blending in the subsequent global optimization stage. To mitigate potential biases of LLM priors, we model collision relationships between objects at the global level, enhancing physical correctness and overall realism.

| 111 | 3D Geometry-aware Deformable Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic View Synthesis | Zhicheng Lu,Xiang Guo,Le Hui,Tianrui Chen,Min Yang,Xiao Tang,Feng Zhu,Yuchao Dai | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we propose a 3D geometry-aware deformable Gaussian Splatting method for dynamic view synthesis. Existing neural radiance fields (NeRF) based solutions learn the deformation in an implicit manner, which cannot incorporate 3D scene geometry. Therefore, the learned deformation is not necessarily geometrically coherent, which results in unsatisfactory dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting provides a new representation of the 3D scene, building upon which the 3D geometry could be exploited in learning the complex 3D deformation. Specifically, the scenes are represented as a collection of 3D Gaussian, where each 3D Gaussian is optimized to move and rotate over time to model the deformation. To enforce the 3D scene geometry constraint during deformation, we explicitly extract 3D geometry features and integrate them in learning the 3D deformation. In this way, our solution achieves 3D geometry-aware deformation modeling, which enables improved dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets prove the superiority of our solution, which achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Our assessment of GauU-Scene includes a detailed analysis across various novel viewpoints, employing image-based metrics such as SSIM, LPIPS, and PSNR on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting based methods. This analysis reveals contradictory results when applying geometric-based metrics like Chamfer distance. The experimental results on our multimodal dataset highlight the unreliability of current image-based metrics and reveal significant drawbacks in geometric reconstruction using the current Gaussian Splatting-based method, further illustrating the necessity of our dataset for assessing geometry reconstruction tasks.

| 109 | Recent Advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting | Tong Wu,Yu-Jie Yuan,Ling-Xiao Zhang,Jie Yang,Yan-Pei Cao,Ling-Qi Yan,Lin Gao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has greatly accelerated the rendering speed of novel view synthesis. Unlike neural implicit representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) that represent a 3D scene with position and viewpoint-conditioned neural networks, 3D Gaussian Splatting utilizes a set of Gaussian ellipsoids to model the scene so that efficient rendering can be accomplished by rasterizing Gaussian ellipsoids into images. Apart from the fast rendering speed, the explicit representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting facilitates editing tasks like dynamic reconstruction, geometry editing, and physical simulation. Considering the rapid change and growing number of works in this field, we present a literature review of recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, which can be roughly classified into 3D reconstruction, 3D editing, and other downstream applications by functionality. Traditional point-based rendering methods and the rendering formulation of 3D Gaussian Splatting are also illustrated for a better understanding of this technique. This survey aims to help beginners get into this field quickly and provide experienced researchers with a comprehensive overview, which can stimulate the future development of the 3D Gaussian Splatting representation.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11134](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11134) |
| 108 | SpikeNVS: Enhancing Novel View Synthesis from Blurry Images via Spike Camera | Gaole Dai,Zhenyu Wang,Qinwen Xu,Ming Lu,Wen Chen,Boxin Shi,Shanghang Zhang,Tiejun Huang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>One of the most critical factors in achieving sharp Novel View Synthesis (NVS) using neural field methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is the quality of the training images. However, Conventional RGB cameras are susceptible to motion blur. In contrast, neuromorphic cameras like event and spike cameras inherently capture more comprehensive temporal information, which can provide a sharp representation of the scene as additional training data. Recent methods have explored the integration of event cameras to improve the quality of NVS. The event-RGB approaches have some limitations, such as high training costs and the inability to work effectively in the background. Instead, our study introduces a new method that uses the spike camera to overcome these limitations. By considering texture reconstruction from spike streams as ground truth, we design the Texture from Spike (TfS) loss. Since the spike camera relies on temporal integration instead of temporal differentiation used by event cameras, our proposed TfS loss maintains manageable training costs. It handles foreground objects with backgrounds simultaneously. We also provide a real-world dataset captured with our spike-RGB camera system to facilitate future research endeavors. We conduct extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our design can enhance novel view synthesis across NeRF and 3DGS. The code and dataset will be made available for public access.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06710](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06710) |

Our technique optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation to match complex text prompts. We initialize these splats by utilizing the state-of-the-art text-to-image generators, lifting their samples into 3D, and computing the occlusion volume. We then optimize this representation across multiple views as a 3D inpainting task with image-conditional diffusion models. To learn correct geometric structure, we incorporate a depth diffusion model by conditioning on the samples from the inpainting model, giving rich geometric structure. Finally, we finetune the model using sharpened samples from image generators. Notably, our technique does not require video or multi-view data and can synthesize a variety of high-quality 3D scenes in different styles, consisting of multiple objects. Its generality additionally allows 3D synthesis from a single image.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07199](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07199) |
| 104 | SplatPose & Detect: Pose-Agnostic 3D Anomaly Detection | Mathis Kruse,Marco Rudolph,Dominik Woiwode,Bodo Rosenhahn | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Detecting anomalies in images has become a well-explored problem in both academia and industry. State-of-the-art algorithms are able to detect defects in increasingly difficult settings and data modalities. However, most current methods are not suited to address 3D objects captured from differing poses. While solutions using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been proposed, they suffer from excessive computation requirements, which hinder real-world usability. For this reason, we propose the novel 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework SplatPose which, given multi-view images of a 3D object, accurately estimates the pose of unseen views in a differentiable manner, and detects anomalies in them. We achieve state-of-the-art results in both training and inference speed, and detection performance, even when using less training data than competing methods. We thoroughly evaluate our framework using the recently proposed Pose-agnostic Anomaly Detection benchmark and its multi-pose anomaly detection (MAD) data set.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06832](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06832) |

Conventional completion methods typically depend on extensive point cloud data for training %, with their effectiveness often constrained to object categories similar to those seen during training. In contrast, we propose a zero-shot framework aimed at completing partially observed point clouds across any unseen categories. Leveraging point rendering via Gaussian Splatting, we develop techniques of Point Cloud Colorization and Zero-shot Fractal Completion that utilize 2D priors from pre-trained diffusion models to infer missing regions. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world scanned point clouds demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in completing a variety of objects without any requirement for specific training data.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06814](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06814) |

ADC has been introduced for automatic 3D point primitive management, controlling densification and pruning, however, with certain limitations in the densification logic. Our main contribution is a more principled, pixel-error driven formulation for density control in 3DGS, leveraging an auxiliary, per-pixel error function as the criterion for densification. We further introduce a mechanism to control the total number of primitives generated per scene and correct a bias in the current opacity handling strategy of ADC during cloning operations.

| 101 | Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation | Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The evolution of 3D generative modeling has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for 3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model's inference in 3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly, this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments covering 5 text-to-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D's versatility to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 to 4 times. Additionally, Hash3D's integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly 30 seconds.

| 100 | FreGS: 3D Gaussian Splatting with Progressive Frequency Regularization | Jiahui Zhang,Fangneng Zhan,Muyu Xu,Shijian Lu,Eric Xing | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian splatting has achieved very impressive performance in real-time novel view synthesis. However, it often suffers from over-reconstruction during Gaussian densification where high-variance image regions are covered by a few large Gaussians only, leading to blur and artifacts in the rendered images. We design a progressive frequency regularization (FreGS) technique to tackle the over-reconstruction issue within the frequency space. Specifically, FreGS performs coarse-to-fine Gaussian densification by exploiting low-to-high frequency components that can be easily extracted with low-pass and high-pass filters in the Fourier space. By minimizing the discrepancy between the frequency spectrum of the rendered image and the corresponding ground truth, it achieves high-quality Gaussian densification and alleviates the over-reconstruction of Gaussian splatting effectively. Experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks (e.g., Mip-NeRF360, Tanks-and-Temples and Deep Blending) show that FreGS achieves superior novel view synthesis and outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06908](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06908) |

Methods that use Neural Radiance fields are versatile for traditional tasks such as novel view synthesis. In recent times, some work has emerged that aims to extend the functionality of NeRF beyond view synthesis, for semantically aware tasks such as editing and segmentation using 3D feature field distillation from 2D foundation models. However, these methods have two major limitations: (a) they are limited by the rendering speed of NeRF pipelines, and (b) implicitly represented feature fields suffer from continuity artifacts reducing feature quality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown state-of-the-art performance on real-time radiance field rendering. In this work, we go one step further: in addition to radiance field rendering, we enable 3D Gaussian splatting on arbitrary-dimension semantic features via 2D foundation model distillation. This translation is not straightforward: naively incorporating feature fields in the 3DGS framework encounters significant challenges, notably the disparities in spatial resolution and channel consistency between RGB images and feature maps. We propose architectural and training changes to efficiently avert this problem. Our proposed method is general, and our experiments showcase novel view semantic segmentation, language-guided editing and segment anything through learning feature fields from state-of-the-art 2D foundation models such as SAM and CLIP-LSeg. Across experiments, our distillation method is able to provide comparable or better results, while being significantly faster to both train and render. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first method to enable point and bounding-box prompting for radiance field manipulation, by leveraging the SAM model.

It facilitates a better balance between efficiency and accuracy. Compared to recent SLAM methods employing neural implicit representations, our method utilizes a real-time differentiable splatting rendering pipeline that offers significant speedup to map optimization and RGB-D rendering. Specifically, we propose an adaptive expansion strategy that adds new or deletes noisy 3D Gaussians in order to efficiently reconstruct new observed scene geometry and improve the mapping of previously observed areas. This strategy is essential to extend 3D Gaussian representation to reconstruct the whole scene rather than synthesize a static object in existing methods. Moreover, in the pose tracking process, an effective coarse-to-fine technique is designed to select reliable 3D Gaussian representations to optimize camera pose, resulting in runtime reduction and robust estimation. Our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art real-time methods on the Replica, TUM-RGBD datasets.

Our main contribution involves modeling motion blur as a Gaussian distribution over camera poses, allowing us to address both camera pose refinement and motion blur correction in a unified way. Additionally, we propose mechanisms for defocus blur compensation and for addressing color in-consistencies caused by ambient light, shadows, or due to camera-related factors like varying white balancing settings. Our proposed solutions integrate in a seamless way with the 3DGS formulation while maintaining its benefits in terms of training efficiency and rendering speed.

More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting emerged as a much faster alternative with superior rendering quality and training efficiency, especially for small-scale and object-centric scenarios. Nevertheless, this technique suffers from poor performance on unstructured in-the-wild data. To tackle this, we extend over 3D Gaussian Splatting to handle unstructured image collections. We achieve this by modeling appearance to seize photometric variations in the rendered images. Additionally, we introduce a new mechanism to train transient Gaussians to handle the presence of scene occluders in an unsupervised manner. Experiments on diverse photo collection scenes and multi-pass acquisition of outdoor landmarks show the effectiveness of our method over prior works achieving state-of-the-art results with improved efficiency.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10427](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10427) |

Despite recent advancements, simultaneously achieving high-resolution photorealistic results, real-time rendering, and compact storage remains a formidable task. To address these challenges, we propose Spacetime Gaussian Feature Splatting as a novel dynamic scene representation, composed of three pivotal components. First, we formulate expressive Spacetime Gaussians by enhancing 3D Gaussians with temporal opacity and parametric motion/rotation. This enables Spacetime Gaussians to capture static, dynamic, as well as transient content within a scene. Second, we introduce splatted feature rendering, which replaces spherical harmonics with neural features. These features facilitate the modeling of view- and time-dependent appearance while maintaining small size. Third, we leverage the guidance of training error and coarse depth to sample new Gaussians in areas that are challenging to converge with existing pipelines. Experiments on several established real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and speed, while retaining compact storage. At 8K resolution, our lite-version model can render at 60 FPS on an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU.

To overcome local minima inherent to sparse and locally supported representations, we predict a dense probability distribution over 3D and sample Gaussian means from that probability distribution. We make this sampling operation differentiable via a reparameterization trick, allowing us to back-propagate gradients through the Gaussian splatting representation. We benchmark our method on wide-baseline novel view synthesis on the real-world RealEstate10k and ACID datasets, where we outperform state-of-the-art light field transformers and accelerate rendering by 2.5 orders of magnitude while reconstructing an interpretable and editable 3D radiance field.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12337](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12337) |

Existing methods based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) achieve high-quality novel-view/novel-pose image synthesis but often require days of training, and are extremely slow at inference time. Recently, the community has explored fast grid structures for efficient training of clothed avatars. Albeit being extremely fast at training, these methods can barely achieve an interactive rendering frame rate with around 15 FPS. In this paper, we use 3D Gaussian Splatting and learn a non-rigid deformation network to reconstruct animatable clothed human avatars that can be trained within 30 minutes and rendered at real-time frame rates (50+ FPS). Given the explicit nature of our representation, we further introduce as-isometric-as-possible regularizations on both the Gaussian mean vectors and the covariance matrices, enhancing the generalization of our model on highly articulated unseen poses. Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable and even better performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches on animatable avatar creation from a monocular input, while being 400x and 250x faster in training and inference, respectively.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09228](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09228) |

We adapt the Gaussian Splatting framework to enable novel view synthesis in CT based on limited sets of 2D image projections and without the need for Structure from Motion (SfM) methodologies. Therefore, we reduce the total scanning duration and the amount of radiation dose the patient receives during the scan. We adapted the loss function to our use-case by encouraging a stronger background and foreground distinction using two sparsity promoting regularizers: a beta loss and a total variation (TV) loss. Finally, we initialize the Gaussian locations across the 3D space using a uniform prior distribution of where the brain's positioning would be expected to be within the field of view. We evaluate the performance of our model using brain CT scans from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset and demonstrate that the rendered novel views closely match the original projection views of the simulated scan, and have better performance than other implicit 3D scene representations methodologies. Furthermore, we empirically observe reduced training time compared to neural network based image synthesis for sparse-view CT image reconstruction. Finally, the memory requirements of the Gaussian Splatting representations are reduced by 17% compared to the equivalent voxel grid image representations.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03126](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03126) |

Instead of leveraging matching-based solutions from 2D wireframes (or line segments) for 3D wireframe reconstruction as done in prior arts, we present NEAT, a rendering-distilling formulation using neural fields to represent 3D line segments with 2D observations, and bipartite matching for perceiving and distilling of a sparse set of 3D global junctions. The proposed {NEAT} enjoys the joint optimization of the neural fields and the global junctions from scratch, using view-dependent 2D observations without precomputed cross-view feature matching. Comprehensive experiments on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets demonstrate our NEAT's superiority over state-of-the-art alternatives for 3D wireframe reconstruction. Moreover, the distilled 3D global junctions by NEAT, are a better initialization than SfM points, for the recently-emerged 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-fidelity novel view synthesis using about 20 times fewer initial 3D points.

| 90 | Analytic-Splatting: Anti-Aliased 3D Gaussian Splatting via Analytic Integration | Zhihao Liang,Qi Zhang,Wenbo Hu,Ying Feng,Lei Zhu,Kui Jia | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gained its popularity recently by combining the advantages of both primitive-based and volumetric 3D representations, resulting in improved quality and efficiency for 3D scene rendering. However, 3DGS is not alias-free, and its rendering at varying resolutions could produce severe blurring or jaggies. This is because 3DGS treats each pixel as an isolated, single point rather than as an area, causing insensitivity to changes in the footprints of pixels. Consequently, this discrete sampling scheme inevitably results in aliasing, owing to the restricted sampling bandwidth. In this paper, we derive an analytical solution to address this issue. More specifically, we use a conditioned logistic function as the analytic approximation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) in a one-dimensional Gaussian signal and calculate the Gaussian integral by subtracting the CDFs. We then introduce this approximation in the two-dimensional pixel shading, and present Analytic-Splatting, which analytically approximates the Gaussian integral within the 2D-pixel window area to better capture the intensity response of each pixel. Moreover, we use the approximated response of the pixel window integral area to participate in the transmittance calculation of volume rendering, making Analytic-Splatting sensitive to the changes in pixel footprint at different resolutions. Experiments on various datasets validate that our approach has better anti-aliasing capability that gives more details and better fidelity.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11056](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11056) |

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods have recently risen to prominence for their exceptional ability to reconstruct scenes but are hampered by slow inference speed, prolonged training, and inconsistent depth estimation. Some previous work utilizes ground truth depth for optimization but is hard to acquire in the surgical domain. To overcome these obstacles, we present Endo-4DGS, a real-time endoscopic dynamic reconstruction approach that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) for 3D representation. Specifically, we propose lightweight MLPs to capture temporal dynamics with Gaussian deformation fields. To obtain a satisfactory Gaussian Initialization, we exploit a powerful depth estimation foundation model, Depth-Anything, to generate pseudo-depth maps as a geometry prior. We additionally propose confidence-guided learning to tackle the ill-pose problems in monocular depth estimation and enhance the depth-guided reconstruction with surface normal constraints and depth regularization.

| 88 | Text-to-3D using Gaussian Splatting | Zilong Chen,Feng Wang,Yikai Wang,Huaping Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Automatic text-to-3D generation that combines Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with the optimization of volume rendering has achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing realistic 3D objects. Yet most existing text-to-3D methods by SDS and volume rendering suffer from inaccurate geometry, e.g., the Janus issue, since it is hard to explicitly integrate 3D priors into implicit 3D representations. Besides, it is usually time-consuming for them to generate elaborate 3D models with rich colors. In response, this paper proposes GSGEN, a novel method that adopts Gaussian Splatting, a recent state-of-the-art representation, to text-to-3D generation. GSGEN aims at generating high-quality 3D objects and addressing existing shortcomings by exploiting the explicit nature of Gaussian Splatting that enables the incorporation of 3D prior. Specifically, our method adopts a progressive optimization strategy, which includes a geometry optimization stage and an appearance refinement stage. In geometry optimization, a coarse representation is established under 3D point cloud diffusion prior along with the ordinary 2D SDS optimization, ensuring a sensible and 3D-consistent rough shape. Subsequently, the obtained Gaussians undergo an iterative appearance refinement to enrich texture details. In this stage, we increase the number of Gaussians by compactness-based densification to enhance continuity and improve fidelity. With these designs, our approach can generate 3D assets with delicate details and accurate geometry. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially for capturing high-frequency components.

Many graphics applications, however, demand the ability to manipulate both the appearance and the physical properties of objects. We introduce Feature Splatting, an approach that unifies physics-based dynamic scene synthesis with rich semantics from vision language foundation models that are grounded by natural language. Our first contribution is a way to distill high-quality, object-centric vision-language features into 3D Gaussians, that enables semi-automatic scene decomposition using text queries. Our second contribution is a way to synthesize physics-based dynamics from an otherwise static scene using a particle-based simulator, in which material properties are assigned automatically via text queries. We ablate key techniques used in this pipeline, to illustrate the challenge and opportunities in using feature-carrying 3D Gaussians as a unified format for appearance, geometry, material properties and semantics grounded on natural language.

| 86 | Mirror-3DGS: Incorporating Mirror Reflections into 3D Gaussian Splatting | Jiarui Meng,Haijie Li,Yanmin Wu,Qiankun Gao,Shuzhou Yang,Jian Zhang,Siwei Ma | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant breakthrough in the realm of 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS, much like its predecessor Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), struggles to accurately model physical reflections, particularly in mirrors that are ubiquitous in real-world scenes. This oversight mistakenly perceives reflections as separate entities that physically exist, resulting in inaccurate reconstructions and inconsistent reflective properties across varied viewpoints. To address this pivotal challenge, we introduce Mirror-3DGS, an innovative rendering framework devised to master the intricacies of mirror geometries and reflections, paving the way for the generation of realistically depicted mirror reflections. By ingeniously incorporating mirror attributes into the 3DGS and leveraging the principle of plane mirror imaging, Mirror-3DGS crafts a mirrored viewpoint to observe from behind the mirror, enriching the realism of scene renderings. Extensive assessments, spanning both synthetic and real-world scenes, showcase our method's ability to render novel views with enhanced fidelity in real-time, surpassing the state-of-the-art Mirror-NeRF specifically within the challenging mirror regions. Our code will be made publicly available for reproducible research.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01168](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01168) |

Humphreys,Ufuk Topcu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Simultaneous localization and mapping is essential for position tracking and scene understanding. 3D Gaussian-based map representations enable photorealistic reconstruction and real-time rendering of scenes using multiple posed cameras. We show for the first time that using 3D Gaussians for map representation with unposed camera images and inertial measurements can enable accurate SLAM. Our method, MM3DGS, addresses the limitations of prior neural radiance field-based representations by enabling faster rendering, scale awareness, and improved trajectory tracking. Our framework enables keyframe-based mapping and tracking utilizing loss functions that incorporate relative pose transformations from pre-integrated inertial measurements, depth estimates, and measures of photometric rendering quality. We also release a multi-modal dataset, UT-MM, collected from a mobile robot equipped with a camera and an inertial measurement unit. Experimental evaluation on several scenes from the dataset shows that MM3DGS achieves 3x improvement in tracking and 5% improvement in photometric rendering quality compared to the current 3DGS SLAM state-of-the-art, while allowing real-time rendering of a high-resolution dense 3D map.

| 84 | SC-GS: Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting for Editable Dynamic Scenes | Yi-Hua Huang,Yang-Tian Sun,Ziyi Yang,Xiaoyang Lyu,Yan-Pei Cao,Xiaojuan Qi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes is still a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Recently, Gaussian splatting has emerged as a robust technique to represent static scenes and enable high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. Building upon this technique, we propose a new representation that explicitly decomposes the motion and appearance of dynamic scenes into sparse control points and dense Gaussians, respectively. Our key idea is to use sparse control points, significantly fewer in number than the Gaussians, to learn compact 6 DoF transformation bases, which can be locally interpolated through learned interpolation weights to yield the motion field of 3D Gaussians. We employ a deformation MLP to predict time-varying 6 DoF transformations for each control point, which reduces learning complexities, enhances learning abilities, and facilitates obtaining temporal and spatial coherent motion patterns. Then, we jointly learn the 3D Gaussians, the canonical space locations of control points, and the deformation MLP to reconstruct the appearance, geometry, and dynamics of 3D scenes. During learning, the location and number of control points are adaptively adjusted to accommodate varying motion complexities in different regions, and an ARAP loss following the principle of as rigid as possible is developed to enforce spatial continuity and local rigidity of learned motions. Finally, thanks to the explicit sparse motion representation and its decomposition from appearance, our method can enable user-controlled motion editing while retaining high-fidelity appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing approaches on novel view synthesis with a high rendering speed and enables novel appearance-preserved motion editing applications.

| 83 | LangSplat: 3D Language Gaussian Splatting | Minghan Qin,Wanhua Li,Jiawei Zhou,Haoqian Wang,Hanspeter Pfister | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Humans live in a 3D world and commonly use natural language to interact with a 3D scene. Modeling a 3D language field to support open-ended language queries in 3D has gained increasing attention recently. This paper introduces LangSplat, which constructs a 3D language field that enables precise and efficient open-vocabulary querying within 3D spaces. Unlike existing methods that ground CLIP language embeddings in a NeRF model, LangSplat advances the field by utilizing a collection of 3D Gaussians, each encoding language features distilled from CLIP, to represent the language field. By employing a tile-based splatting technique for rendering language features, we circumvent the costly rendering process inherent in NeRF. Instead of directly learning CLIP embeddings, LangSplat first trains a scene-wise language autoencoder and then learns language features on the scene-specific latent space, thereby alleviating substantial memory demands imposed by explicit modeling. Existing methods struggle with imprecise and vague 3D language fields, which fail to discern clear boundaries between objects. We delve into this issue and propose to learn hierarchical semantics using SAM, thereby eliminating the need for extensively querying the language field across various scales and the regularization of DINO features. Extensive experimental results show that LangSplat significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method LERF by a large margin. Notably, LangSplat is extremely efficient, achieving a 199 $\\times$ speedup compared to LERF at the resolution of 1440 $\\times$ 1080.

| 82 | 3DGSR: Implicit Surface Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Xiaoyang Lyu,Yang-Tian Sun,Yi-Hua Huang,Xiuzhe Wu,Ziyi Yang,Yilun Chen,Jiangmiao Pang,Xiaojuan Qi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we present an implicit surface reconstruction method with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), namely 3DGSR, that allows for accurate 3D reconstruction with intricate details while inheriting the high efficiency and rendering quality of 3DGS. The key insight is incorporating an implicit signed distance field (SDF) within 3D Gaussians to enable them to be aligned and jointly optimized. First, we introduce a differentiable SDF-to-opacity transformation function that converts SDF values into corresponding Gaussians' opacities. This function connects the SDF and 3D Gaussians, allowing for unified optimization and enforcing surface constraints on the 3D Gaussians. During learning, optimizing the 3D Gaussians provides supervisory signals for SDF learning, enabling the reconstruction of intricate details. However, this only provides sparse supervisory signals to the SDF at locations occupied by Gaussians, which is insufficient for learning a continuous SDF. Then, to address this limitation, we incorporate volumetric rendering and align the rendered geometric attributes (depth, normal) with those derived from 3D Gaussians. This consistency regularization introduces supervisory signals to locations not covered by discrete 3D Gaussians, effectively eliminating redundant surfaces outside the Gaussian sampling range. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our 3DGSR method enables high-quality 3D surface reconstruction while preserving the efficiency and rendering quality of 3DGS. Besides, our method competes favorably with leading surface reconstruction techniques while offering a more efficient learning process and much better rendering qualities. The code will be available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/3DGSR.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00409](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00409) |
| 81 | SplatFace: Gaussian Splat Face Reconstruction Leveraging an Optimizable Surface | Jiahao Luo,Jing Liu,James Davis | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present SplatFace, a novel Gaussian splatting framework designed for 3D human face reconstruction without reliance on accurate pre-determined geometry. Our method is designed to simultaneously deliver both high-quality novel view rendering and accurate 3D mesh reconstructions. We incorporate a generic 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) to provide a surface geometric structure, making it possible to reconstruct faces with a limited set of input images. We introduce a joint optimization strategy that refines both the Gaussians and the morphable surface through a synergistic non-rigid alignment process. A novel distance metric, splat-to-surface, is proposed to improve alignment by considering both the Gaussian position and covariance. The surface information is also utilized to incorporate a world-space densification process, resulting in superior reconstruction quality. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed method is competitive with both other Gaussian splatting techniques in novel view synthesis and other 3D reconstruction methods in producing 3D face meshes with high geometric precision.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18784](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18784) |
| 80 | LightGaussian: Unbounded 3D Gaussian Compression with 15x Reduction and 200+ FPS | Zhiwen Fan,Kevin Wang,Kairun Wen,Zehao Zhu,Dejia Xu,Zhangyang Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in real-time neural rendering using point-based techniques have paved the way for the widespread adoption of 3D representations. However, foundational approaches like 3D Gaussian Splatting come with a substantial storage overhead caused by growing the SfM points to millions, often demanding gigabyte-level disk space for a single unbounded scene, posing significant scalability challenges and hindering the splatting efficiency.  To address this challenge, we introduce LightGaussian, a novel method designed to transform 3D Gaussians into a more efficient and compact format. Drawing inspiration from the concept of Network Pruning, LightGaussian identifies Gaussians that are insignificant in contributing to the scene reconstruction and adopts a pruning and recovery process, effectively reducing redundancy in Gaussian counts while preserving visual effects. Additionally, LightGaussian employs distillation and pseudo-view augmentation to distill spherical harmonics to a lower degree, allowing knowledge transfer to more compact representations while maintaining reflectance. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid scheme, VecTree Quantization, to quantize all attributes, resulting in lower bitwidth representations with minimal accuracy losses.  In summary, LightGaussian achieves an averaged compression rate over 15x while boosting the FPS from 139 to 215, enabling an efficient representation of complex scenes on Mip-NeRF 360, Tank and Temple datasets.

Lepora,Laurence Aitchison | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Touch and vision go hand in hand, mutually enhancing our ability to understand the world. From a research perspective, the problem of mixing touch and vision is underexplored and presents interesting challenges. To this end, we propose Tactile-Informed 3DGS, a novel approach that incorporates touch data (local depth maps) with multi-view vision data to achieve surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Our method optimises 3D Gaussian primitives to accurately model the object's geometry at points of contact. By creating a framework that decreases the transmittance at touch locations, we achieve a refined surface reconstruction, ensuring a uniformly smooth depth map. Touch is particularly useful when considering non-Lambertian objects (e.g. shiny or reflective surfaces) since contemporary methods tend to fail to reconstruct with fidelity specular highlights. By combining vision and tactile sensing, we achieve more accurate geometry reconstructions with fewer images than prior methods. We conduct evaluation on objects with glossy and reflective surfaces and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, offering significant improvements in reconstruction quality.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20275](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20275) |

Recent advancements in mapping methods are mainly based on NeRF, whose rendering speed is too slow to meet online requirements. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with its rendering speed hundreds of times faster than NeRF, holds greater potential in online dense mapping. However, integrating 3DGS into a street-view dense mapping framework still faces two challenges, including incomplete reconstruction due to the absence of geometric information beyond the LiDAR coverage area and extensive computation for reconstruction in large urban scenes. To this end, we propose HGS-Mapping, an online dense mapping framework in unbounded large-scale scenes. To attain complete construction, our framework introduces Hybrid Gaussian Representation, which models different parts of the entire scene using Gaussians with distinct properties. Furthermore, we employ a hybrid Gaussian initialization mechanism and an adaptive update method to achieve high-fidelity and rapid reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate Gaussian representation into online dense mapping of urban scenes. Our approach achieves SOTA reconstruction accuracy while only employing 66% number of Gaussians, leading to 20% faster reconstruction speed.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20159](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20159) |

The current mainstream technique to achieve it is neural rendering, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Although thrilling progress has been made, when handling street scenes, current methods struggle to maintain rendering quality at the viewpoint that deviates significantly from the training viewpoints. This issue stems from the sparse training views captured by a fixed camera on a moving vehicle. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach that enhances the capacity of 3DGS by leveraging prior from a Diffusion Model along with complementary multi-modal data. Specifically, we first fine-tune a Diffusion Model by adding images from adjacent frames as condition, meanwhile exploiting depth data from LiDAR point clouds to supply additional spatial information. Then we apply the Diffusion Model to regularize the 3DGS at unseen views during training. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method compared with current state-of-the-art models, and demonstrate its advance in rendering images from broader views.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20079](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20079) |

Though promising results have been exhibited, these methods often suffer from slow per-sample optimization, limiting their practical usage. In this paper, we propose DreamGaussian, a novel 3D content generation framework that achieves both efficiency and quality simultaneously. Our key insight is to design a generative 3D Gaussian Splatting model with companioned mesh extraction and texture refinement in UV space. In contrast to the occupancy pruning used in Neural Radiance Fields, we demonstrate that the progressive densification of 3D Gaussians converges significantly faster for 3D generative tasks. To further enhance the texture quality and facilitate downstream applications, we introduce an efficient algorithm to convert 3D Gaussians into textured meshes and apply a fine-tuning stage to refine the details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and competitive generation quality of our proposed approach.

However, the previous 3DGS-based methods have limitations in urban scenes due to reliance on initial Structure-from-Motion(SfM) points and difficulties in rendering distant, sky and low-texture areas. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid optimization method named HO-Gaussian, which combines a grid-based volume with the 3DGS pipeline. HO-Gaussian eliminates the dependency on SfM point initialization, allowing for rendering of urban scenes, and incorporates the Point Densitification to enhance rendering quality in problematic regions during training. Furthermore, we introduce Gaussian Direction Encoding as an alternative for spherical harmonics in the rendering pipeline, which enables view-dependent color representation. To account for multi-camera systems, we introduce neural warping to enhance object consistency across different cameras. Experimental results on widely used autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that HO-Gaussian achieves photo-realistic rendering in real-time on multi-camera urban datasets.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20032](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20032) |
| 74 | GAvatar: Animatable 3D Gaussian Avatars with Implicit Mesh Learning | Ye Yuan,Xueting Li,Yangyi Huang,Shalini De Mello,Koki Nagano,Jan Kautz,Umar Iqbal | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful 3D representation that harnesses the advantages of both explicit (mesh) and implicit (NeRF) 3D representations. In this paper, we seek to leverage Gaussian splatting to generate realistic animatable avatars from textual descriptions, addressing the limitations (e.g., flexibility and efficiency) imposed by mesh or NeRF-based representations. However, a naive application of Gaussian splatting cannot generate high-quality animatable avatars and suffers from learning instability; it also cannot capture fine avatar geometries and often leads to degenerate body parts. To tackle these problems, we first propose a primitive-based 3D Gaussian representation where Gaussians are defined inside pose-driven primitives to facilitate animation. Second, to stabilize and amortize the learning of millions of Gaussians, we propose to use neural implicit fields to predict the Gaussian attributes (e.g., colors). Finally, to capture fine avatar geometries and extract detailed meshes, we propose a novel SDF-based implicit mesh learning approach for 3D Gaussians that regularizes the underlying geometries and extracts highly detailed textured meshes. Our proposed method, GAvatar, enables the large-scale generation of diverse animatable avatars using only text prompts. GAvatar significantly surpasses existing methods in terms of both appearance and geometry quality, and achieves extremely fast rendering (100 fps) at 1K resolution.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11461](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11461) |

While the state-of-the-art method Mip-Splatting needs modifying the training procedure of Gaussian splatting, our method functions at test-time and is training-free. Specifically, SA-GS can be applied to any pretrained Gaussian splatting field as a plugin to significantly improve the field's anti-alising performance. The core technique is to apply 2D scale-adaptive filters to each Gaussian during test time. As pointed out by Mip-Splatting, observing Gaussians at different frequencies leads to mismatches between the Gaussian scales during training and testing. Mip-Splatting resolves this issue using 3D smoothing and 2D Mip filters, which are unfortunately not aware of testing frequency. In this work, we show that a 2D scale-adaptive filter that is informed of testing frequency can effectively match the Gaussian scale, thus making the Gaussian primitive distribution remain consistent across different testing frequencies. When scale inconsistency is eliminated, sampling rates smaller than the scene frequency result in conventional jaggedness, and we propose to integrate the projected 2D Gaussian within each pixel during testing. This integration is actually a limiting case of super-sampling, which significantly improves anti-aliasing performance over vanilla Gaussian Splatting. Through extensive experiments using various settings and both bounded and unbounded scenes, we show SA-GS performs comparably with or better than Mip-Splatting. Note that super-sampling and integration are only effective when our scale-adaptive filtering is activated.

While the classical approaches to model and render virtual humans generally use a textured mesh, recent research has developed neural body representations that achieve impressive visual quality. However, these models are difficult to render in real-time and their quality degrades when the character is animated with body poses different than the training observations. We propose an animatable human model based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, that has recently emerged as a very efficient alternative to neural radiance fields. The body is represented by a set of gaussian primitives in a canonical space which is deformed with a coarse to fine approach that combines forward skinning and local non-rigid refinement. We describe how to learn our Human Gaussian Splatting (HuGS) model in an end-to-end fashion from multi-view observations, and evaluate it against the state-of-the-art approaches for novel pose synthesis of clothed body.

However, this challenging problem requires accurate modeling of the contact between hands and objects. To capture grasps, existing methods use skeletons, meshes, or parametric models that does not represent hand shape accurately resulting in inaccurate contacts. We present MANUS, a method for Markerless Hand-Object Grasp Capture using Articulated 3D Gaussians. We build a novel articulated 3D Gaussians representation that extends 3D Gaussian splatting for high-fidelity representation of articulating hands. Since our representation uses Gaussian primitives, it enables us to efficiently and accurately estimate contacts between the hand and the object. For the most accurate results, our method requires tens of camera views that current datasets do not provide. We therefore build MANUS-Grasps, a new dataset that contains hand-object grasps viewed from 50+ cameras across 30+ scenes, 3 subjects, and comprising over 7M frames. In addition to extensive qualitative results, we also show that our method outperforms others on a quantitative contact evaluation method that uses paint transfer from the object to the hand.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02137](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02137) |

We parameterize each splat by a local coordinate frame of a triangle and optimize for explicit displacement offset to obtain a more accurate geometric representation. During avatar reconstruction, we jointly optimize for the morphable model parameters and Gaussian splat parameters in an end-to-end fashion.

| 68 | CoherentGS: Sparse Novel View Synthesis with Coherent 3D Gaussians | Avinash Paliwal,Wei Ye,Jinhui Xiong,Dmytro Kotovenko,Rakesh Ranjan,Vikas Chandra,Nima Khademi Kalantari | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The field of 3D reconstruction from images has rapidly evolved in the past few years, first with the introduction of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and more recently with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The latter provides a significant edge over NeRF in terms of the training and inference speed, as well as the reconstruction quality. Although 3DGS works well for dense input images, the unstructured point-cloud like representation quickly overfits to the more challenging setup of extremely sparse input images (e.g., 3 images), creating a representation that appears as a jumble of needles from novel views. To address this issue, we propose regularized optimization and depth-based initialization. Our key idea is to introduce a structured Gaussian representation that can be controlled in 2D image space. We then constraint the Gaussians, in particular their position, and prevent them from moving independently during optimization. Specifically, we introduce single and multiview constraints through an implicit convolutional decoder and a total variation loss, respectively. With the coherency introduced to the Gaussians, we further constrain the optimization through a flow-based loss function. To support our regularized optimization, we propose an approach to initialize the Gaussians using monocular depth estimates at each input view.

| 67 | GS-IR: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering | Zhihao Liang,Qi Zhang,Ying Feng,Ying Shan,Kui Jia | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose GS-IR, a novel inverse rendering approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) that leverages forward mapping volume rendering to achieve photorealistic novel view synthesis and relighting results. Unlike previous works that use implicit neural representations and volume rendering (e.g. NeRF), which suffer from low expressive power and high computational complexity, we extend GS, a top-performance representation for novel view synthesis, to estimate scene geometry, surface material, and environment illumination from multi-view images captured under unknown lighting conditions. There are two main problems when introducing GS to inverse rendering: 1) GS does not support producing plausible normal natively; 2) forward mapping (e.g. rasterization and splatting) cannot trace the occlusion like backward mapping (e.g. ray tracing). To address these challenges, our GS-IR proposes an efficient optimization scheme that incorporates a depth-derivation-based regularization for normal estimation and a baking-based occlusion to model indirect lighting. The flexible and expressive GS representation allows us to achieve fast and compact geometry reconstruction, photorealistic novel view synthesis, and effective physically-based rendering. We demonstrate the superiority of our method over baseline methods through qualitative and quantitative evaluations on various challenging scenes.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16473](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16473) |
| 66 | Modeling uncertainty for Gaussian Splatting | Luca Savant,Diego Valsesia,Enrico Magli | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present Stochastic Gaussian Splatting (SGS): the first framework for uncertainty estimation using Gaussian Splatting (GS). GS recently advanced the novel-view synthesis field by achieving impressive reconstruction quality at a fraction of the computational cost of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, contrary to the latter, it still lacks the ability to provide information about the confidence associated with their outputs. To address this limitation, in this paper, we introduce a Variational Inference-based approach that seamlessly integrates uncertainty prediction into the common rendering pipeline of GS. Additionally, we introduce the Area Under Sparsification Error (AUSE) as a new term in the loss function, enabling optimization of uncertainty estimation alongside image reconstruction. Experimental results on the LLFF dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both image rendering quality and uncertainty estimation accuracy. Overall, our framework equips practitioners with valuable insights into the reliability of synthesized views, facilitating safer decision-making in real-world applications.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18476](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18476) |
| 65 | TRIPS: Trilinear Point Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering | Linus Franke,Darius R\xc3\xbcckert,Laura Fink,Marc Stamminger | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Point-based radiance field rendering has demonstrated impressive results for novel view synthesis, offering a compelling blend of rendering quality and computational efficiency. However, also latest approaches in this domain are not without their shortcomings. 3D Gaussian Splatting [Kerbl and Kopanas et al. 2023] struggles when tasked with rendering highly detailed scenes, due to blurring and cloudy artifacts. On the other hand, ADOP [R\xc3\xbcckert et al. 2022] can accommodate crisper images, but the neural reconstruction network decreases performance, it grapples with temporal instability and it is unable to effectively address large gaps in the point cloud.  In this paper, we present TRIPS (Trilinear Point Splatting), an approach that combines ideas from both Gaussian Splatting and ADOP. The fundamental concept behind our novel technique involves rasterizing points into a screen-space image pyramid, with the selection of the pyramid layer determined by the projected point size. This approach allows rendering arbitrarily large points using a single trilinear write. A lightweight neural network is then used to reconstruct a hole-free image including detail beyond splat resolution. Importantly, our render pipeline is entirely differentiable, allowing for automatic optimization of both point sizes and positions.  Our evaluation demonstrate that TRIPS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of rendering quality while maintaining a real-time frame rate of 60 frames per second on readily available hardware. This performance extends to challenging scenarios, such as scenes featuring intricate geometry, expansive landscapes, and auto-exposed footage.

It incorporates appearance, geometry, and semantic features through multi-channel optimization, addressing the oversmoothing limitations of neural implicit SLAM systems in high-quality rendering, scene understanding, and object-level geometry. We introduce a unique semantic feature loss that effectively compensates for the shortcomings of traditional depth and color losses in object optimization. Through a semantic-guided keyframe selection strategy, we prevent erroneous reconstructions caused by cumulative errors.

| 63 | DreamPolisher: Towards High-Quality Text-to-3D Generation via Geometric Diffusion | Yuanze Lin,Ronald Clark,Philip Torr | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present DreamPolisher, a novel Gaussian Splatting based method with geometric guidance, tailored to learn cross-view consistency and intricate detail from textual descriptions. While recent progress on text-to-3D generation methods have been promising, prevailing methods often fail to ensure view-consistency and textural richness. This problem becomes particularly noticeable for methods that work with text input alone. To address this, we propose a two-stage Gaussian Splatting based approach that enforces geometric consistency among views. Initially, a coarse 3D generation undergoes refinement via geometric optimization. Subsequently, we use a ControlNet driven refiner coupled with the geometric consistency term to improve both texture fidelity and overall consistency of the generated 3D asset. Empirical evaluations across diverse textual prompts spanning various object categories demonstrate the efficacy of DreamPolisher in generating consistent and realistic 3D objects, aligning closely with the semantics of the textual instructions.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17237](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17237) |
| 62 | Differentiable Point-based Inverse Rendering | Hoon-Gyu Chung,Seokjun Choi,Seung-Hwan Baek | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present differentiable point-based inverse rendering, DPIR, an analysis-by-synthesis method that processes images captured under diverse illuminations to estimate shape and spatially-varying BRDF. To this end, we adopt point-based rendering, eliminating the need for multiple samplings per ray, typical of volumetric rendering, thus significantly enhancing the speed of inverse rendering. To realize this idea, we devise a hybrid point-volumetric representation for geometry and a regularized basis-BRDF representation for reflectance. The hybrid geometric representation enables fast rendering through point-based splatting while retaining the geometric details and stability inherent to SDF-based representations. The regularized basis-BRDF mitigates the ill-posedness of inverse rendering stemming from limited light-view angular samples. We also propose an efficient shadow detection method using point-based shadow map rendering. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that DPIR outperforms prior works in terms of reconstruction accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory footprint. Furthermore, our explicit point-based representation and rendering enables intuitive geometry and reflectance editing.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02480](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02480) |
| 61 | BAGS: Blur Agnostic Gaussian Splatting through Multi-Scale Kernel Modeling | Cheng Peng,Yutao Tang,Yifan Zhou,Nengyu Wang,Xijun Liu,Deming Li,Rama Chellappa | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent efforts in using 3D Gaussians for scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis can achieve impressive results on curated benchmarks; however, images captured in real life are often blurry. In this work, we analyze the robustness of Gaussian-Splatting-based methods against various image blur, such as motion blur, defocus blur, downscaling blur, \\etc. Under these degradations, Gaussian-Splatting-based methods tend to overfit and produce worse results than Neural-Radiance-Field-based methods. To address this issue, we propose Blur Agnostic Gaussian Splatting (BAGS). BAGS introduces additional 2D modeling capacities such that a 3D-consistent and high quality scene can be reconstructed despite image-wise blur. Specifically, we model blur by estimating per-pixel convolution kernels from a Blur Proposal Network (BPN). BPN is designed to consider spatial, color, and depth variations of the scene to maximize modeling capacity. Additionally, BPN also proposes a quality-assessing mask, which indicates regions where blur occur. Finally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine kernel optimization scheme; this optimization scheme is fast and avoids sub-optimal solutions due to a sparse point cloud initialization, which often occurs when we apply Structure-from-Motion on blurry images. We demonstrate that BAGS achieves photorealistic renderings under various challenging blur conditions and imaging geometry, while significantly improving upon existing approaches.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04926](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04926) |
| 60 | DNGaussian: Optimizing Sparse-View 3D Gaussian Radiance Fields with Global-Local Depth Normalization | Jiahe Li,Jiawei Zhang,Xiao Bai,Jin Zheng,Xin Ning,Jun Zhou,Lin Gu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Radiance fields have demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing novel views from sparse input views, yet prevailing methods suffer from high training costs and slow inference speed. This paper introduces DNGaussian, a depth-regularized framework based on 3D Gaussian radiance fields, offering real-time and high-quality few-shot novel view synthesis at low costs. Our motivation stems from the highly efficient representation and surprising quality of the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting, despite it will encounter a geometry degradation when input views decrease. In the Gaussian radiance fields, we find this degradation in scene geometry primarily lined to the positioning of Gaussian primitives and can be mitigated by depth constraint. Consequently, we propose a Hard and Soft Depth Regularization to restore accurate scene geometry under coarse monocular depth supervision while maintaining a fine-grained color appearance. To further refine detailed geometry reshaping, we introduce Global-Local Depth Normalization, enhancing the focus on small local depth changes. Extensive experiments on LLFF, DTU, and Blender datasets demonstrate that DNGaussian outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving comparable or better results with significantly reduced memory cost, a $25 \\times$ reduction in training time, and over $3000 \\times$ faster rendering speed.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06912](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06912) |

Despite their notable successes in surface modeling and novel view synthesis, existing NeRF-based methods are hindered by their computationally intensive and time-consuming volume rendering pipeline. This paper presents an efficient dense RGB-D SLAM system, i.e., CG-SLAM, based on a novel uncertainty-aware 3D Gaussian field with high consistency and geometric stability. Through an in-depth analysis of Gaussian Splatting, we propose several techniques to construct a consistent and stable 3D Gaussian field suitable for tracking and mapping. Additionally, a novel depth uncertainty model is proposed to ensure the selection of valuable Gaussian primitives during optimization, thereby improving tracking efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CG-SLAM achieves superior tracking and mapping performance with a notable tracking speed of up to 15 Hz.

| 58 | Pixel-GS: Density Control with Pixel-aware Gradient for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Zheng Zhang,Wenbo Hu,Yixing Lao,Tong He,Hengshuang Zhao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis results while advancing real-time rendering performance. However, it relies heavily on the quality of the initial point cloud, resulting in blurring and needle-like artifacts in areas with insufficient initializing points. This is mainly attributed to the point cloud growth condition in 3DGS that only considers the average gradient magnitude of points from observable views, thereby failing to grow for large Gaussians that are observable for many viewpoints while many of them are only covered in the boundaries. To this end, we propose a novel method, named Pixel-GS, to take into account the number of pixels covered by the Gaussian in each view during the computation of the growth condition. We regard the covered pixel numbers as the weights to dynamically average the gradients from different views, such that the growth of large Gaussians can be prompted. As a result, points within the areas with insufficient initializing points can be grown more effectively, leading to a more accurate and detailed reconstruction. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to scale the gradient field according to the distance to the camera, to suppress the growth of floaters near the camera. Extensive experiments both qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed, on the challenging Mip-NeRF 360 and Tanks & Temples datasets.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15530](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15530) |

Oswald | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present a dense simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method that uses 3D Gaussians as a scene representation. Our approach enables interactive-time reconstruction and photo-realistic rendering from real-world single-camera RGBD videos. To this end, we propose a novel effective strategy for seeding new Gaussians for newly explored areas and their effective online optimization that is independent of the scene size and thus scalable to larger scenes. This is achieved by organizing the scene into sub-maps which are independently optimized and do not need to be kept in memory. We further accomplish frame-to-model camera tracking by minimizing photometric and geometric losses between the input and rendered frames. The Gaussian representation allows for high-quality photo-realistic real-time rendering of real-world scenes. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates competitive or superior performance in mapping, tracking, and rendering compared to existing neural dense SLAM methods.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10070](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10070) |

In this paper, we propose a novel dense representation SLAM approach with a fusion of Generalized Iterative Closest Point (G-ICP) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). In contrast to existing methods, we utilize a single Gaussian map for both tracking and mapping, resulting in mutual benefits. Through the exchange of covariances between tracking and mapping processes with scale alignment techniques, we minimize redundant computations and achieve an efficient system. Additionally, we enhance tracking accuracy and mapping quality through our keyframe selection methods.

However, achieving high-fidelity 4D generation with spatial-temporal consistency remains a challenge. In this work, we propose STAG4D, a novel framework that combines pre-trained diffusion models with dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting for high-fidelity 4D generation. Drawing inspiration from 3D generation techniques, we utilize a multi-view diffusion model to initialize multi-view images anchoring on the input video frames, where the video can be either real-world captured or generated by a video diffusion model. To ensure the temporal consistency of the multi-view sequence initialization, we introduce a simple yet effective fusion strategy to leverage the first frame as a temporal anchor in the self-attention computation. With the almost consistent multi-view sequences, we then apply the score distillation sampling to optimize the 4D Gaussian point cloud. The 4D Gaussian spatting is specially crafted for the generation task, where an adaptive densification strategy is proposed to mitigate the unstable Gaussian gradient for robust optimization. Notably, the proposed pipeline does not require any pre-training or fine-tuning of diffusion networks, offering a more accessible and practical solution for the 4D generation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prior 4D generation works in rendering quality, spatial-temporal consistency, and generation robustness, setting a new state-of-the-art for 4D generation from diverse inputs, including text, image, and video.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14939](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14939) |

Our approach builds on the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, which optimizes a set of 3D Gaussians to approximate a radiance field from images. We propose first extracting a base mesh from Gaussians during optimization, then building and refining an adaptive layer of Gaussians with a variable thickness around the mesh to better capture the fine details and volumetric effects near the surface, such as hair or grass. We call this layer Gaussian Frosting, as it resembles a coating of frosting on a cake. The fuzzier the material, the thicker the frosting. We also introduce a parameterization of the Gaussians to enforce them to stay inside the frosting layer and automatically adjust their parameters when deforming, rescaling, editing or animating the mesh. Our representation allows for efficient rendering using Gaussian splatting, as well as editing and animation by modifying the base mesh. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various synthetic and real scenes, and show that it outperforms existing surface-based approaches.

However, it uses anisotropic Gaussian kernels to represent the scene. Although such anisotropic kernels have advantages in representing the geometry, they lead to difficulties in terms of computation, such as splitting or merging two kernels. In this paper, we propose to use isotropic Gaussian kernels to avoid such difficulties in the computation, leading to a higher performance method.

While Radiance Field-based methods achieve state-of-the-art quality in challenging scenarios such as in-the-wild captures and large-scale scenes, they often suffer from excessively high compute requirements linked to volumetric rendering. Gaussian Splatting-based methods, on the other hand, rely on rasterization and naturally achieve real-time rendering but suffer from brittle optimization heuristics that underperform on more challenging scenes. In this work, we present RadSplat, a lightweight method for robust real-time rendering of complex scenes. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we use radiance fields as a prior and supervision signal for optimizing point-based scene representations, leading to improved quality and more robust optimization. Next, we develop a novel pruning technique reducing the overall point count while maintaining high quality, leading to smaller and more compact scene representations with faster inference speeds. Finally, we propose a novel test-time filtering approach that further accelerates rendering and allows to scale to larger, house-sized scenes.

Prior methods often employ high-level architectural priors, separating static and dynamic elements, resulting in suboptimal capture of their synergistic interactions. To address this challenge, we present a unified representation model, called Periodic Vibration Gaussian (PVG). PVG builds upon the efficient 3D Gaussian splatting technique, originally designed for static scene representation, by introducing periodic vibration-based temporal dynamics. This innovation enables PVG to elegantly and uniformly represent the characteristics of various objects and elements in dynamic urban scenes. To enhance temporally coherent and large scene representation learning with sparse training data, we introduce a novel temporal smoothing mechanism and a position-aware adaptive control strategy respectively. Extensive experiments on Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI benchmarks demonstrate that PVG surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in both reconstruction and novel view synthesis for both dynamic and static scenes. Notably, PVG achieves this without relying on manually labeled object bounding boxes or expensive optical flow estimation. Moreover, PVG exhibits 900-fold acceleration in rendering over the best alternative.</details> | November 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18561](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18561) |

Conventional pose estimation methods typically rely on the target's CAD model or necessitate specific network training tailored to particular object classes. Some existing methods have achieved promising results in mesh-free object and scene pose estimation by inverting the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, they still struggle with adverse initializations such as large rotations and translations. To address this issue, we propose an efficient method for accurate camera pose estimation by inverting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Specifically, a gradient-based differentiable framework optimizes camera pose by minimizing the residual between the query image and the rendered image, requiring no training. An end-to-end matching module is designed to enhance the model's robustness against adverse initializations, while minimizing pixel-level comparing loss aids in precise pose estimation. Experimental results on synthetic and complex real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in challenging conditions and the accuracy of camera pose estimation.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09031](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09031) |

| 47 | GaussNav: Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation | Xiaohan Lei,Min Wang,Wengang Zhou,Houqiang Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In embodied vision, Instance ImageGoal Navigation (IIN) requires an agent to locate a specific object depicted in a goal image within an unexplored environment. The primary difficulty of IIN stems from the necessity of recognizing the target object across varying viewpoints and rejecting potential distractors.  Existing map-based navigation methods largely adopt the representation form of Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps, which, however, lack the representation of detailed textures in a scene.  To address the above issues, we propose a new Gaussian Splatting Navigation (abbreviated as GaussNav) framework for IIN task, which constructs a novel map representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).  The proposed framework enables the agent to not only memorize the geometry and semantic information of the scene, but also retain the textural features of objects.  Our GaussNav framework demonstrates a significant leap in performance, evidenced by an increase in Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) from 0.252 to 0.578 on the challenging Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset.

| 45 | BAD-Gaussians: Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting | Lingzhe Zhao,Peng Wang,Peidong Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>While neural rendering has demonstrated impressive capabilities in 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, it heavily relies on high-quality sharp images and accurate camera poses. Numerous approaches have been proposed to train Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with motion-blurred images, commonly encountered in real-world scenarios such as low-light or long-exposure conditions. However, the implicit representation of NeRF struggles to accurately recover intricate details from severely motion-blurred images and cannot achieve real-time rendering. In contrast, recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction and real-time rendering by explicitly optimizing point clouds as Gaussian spheres.  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, named BAD-Gaussians (Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting), which leverages explicit Gaussian representation and handles severe motion-blurred images with inaccurate camera poses to achieve high-quality scene reconstruction. Our method models the physical image formation process of motion-blurred images and jointly learns the parameters of Gaussians while recovering camera motion trajectories during exposure time.

| 44 | Controllable Text-to-3D Generation via Surface-Aligned Gaussian Splatting | Zhiqi Li,Yiming Chen,Lingzhe Zhao,Peidong Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>While text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation tasks have received considerable attention, one important but under-explored field between them is controllable text-to-3D generation, which we mainly focus on in this work. To address this task, 1) we introduce Multi-view ControlNet (MVControl), a novel neural network architecture designed to enhance existing pre-trained multi-view diffusion models by integrating additional input conditions, such as edge, depth, normal, and scribble maps. Our innovation lies in the introduction of a conditioning module that controls the base diffusion model using both local and global embeddings, which are computed from the input condition images and camera poses. Once trained, MVControl is able to offer 3D diffusion guidance for optimization-based 3D generation. And, 2) we propose an efficient multi-stage 3D generation pipeline that leverages the benefits of recent large reconstruction models and score distillation algorithm. Building upon our MVControl architecture, we employ a unique hybrid diffusion guidance method to direct the optimization process. In pursuit of efficiency, we adopt 3D Gaussians as our representation instead of the commonly used implicit representations. We also pioneer the use of SuGaR, a hybrid representation that binds Gaussians to mesh triangle faces. This approach alleviates the issue of poor geometry in 3D Gaussians and enables the direct sculpting of fine-grained geometry on the mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization and enables the controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09981](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09981) |

Specifically, we design a novel joint learning framework that consists of an Iterative Pose Optimization Network (IPO-Net) and a Generalizable 3D-Gaussians (G-3DG) model. With the joint learning mechanism, the proposed framework can inherently estimate robust relative pose information from the image observations and thus primarily alleviate the requirement of real camera poses. Moreover, we implement a deferred back-propagation mechanism that enables high-resolution training and inference, overcoming the resolution constraints of previous methods. To enhance the speed and efficiency, we further introduce a progressive Gaussian cache module that dynamically adjusts during training and inference. As the first pose-free generalizable 3D-GS framework, GGRt achieves inference at $\\ge$ 5 FPS and real-time rendering at $\\ge$ 100 FPS. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing NeRF-based pose-free techniques in terms of inference speed and effectiveness. It can also approach the real pose-based 3D-GS methods. Our contributions provide a significant leap forward for the integration of computer vision and computer graphics into practical applications, offering state-of-the-art results on LLFF, KITTI, and Waymo Open datasets and enabling real-time rendering for immersive experiences.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10147](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10147) |
| 42 | Fed3DGS: Scalable 3D Gaussian Splatting with Federated Learning | Teppei Suzuki | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this work, we present Fed3DGS, a scalable 3D reconstruction framework based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) with federated learning. Existing city-scale reconstruction methods typically adopt a centralized approach, which gathers all data in a central server and reconstructs scenes. The approach hampers scalability because it places a heavy load on the server and demands extensive data storage when reconstructing scenes on a scale beyond city-scale. In pursuit of a more scalable 3D reconstruction, we propose a federated learning framework with 3DGS, which is a decentralized framework and can potentially use distributed computational resources across millions of clients. We tailor a distillation-based model update scheme for 3DGS and introduce appearance modeling for handling non-IID data in the scenario of 3D reconstruction with federated learning. We simulate our method on several large-scale benchmarks, and our method demonstrates rendered image quality comparable to centralized approaches. In addition, we also simulate our method with data collected in different seasons, demonstrating that our framework can reflect changes in the scenes and our appearance modeling captures changes due to seasonal variations.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11460](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11460) |
| 41 | Bridging 3D Gaussian and Mesh for Freeview Video Rendering | Yuting Xiao,Xuan Wang,Jiafei Li,Hongrui Cai,Yanbo Fan,Nan Xue,Minghui Yang,Yujun Shen,Shenghua Gao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This is only a preview version of GauMesh. Recently, primitive-based rendering has been proven to achieve convincing results in solving the problem of modeling and rendering the 3D dynamic scene from 2D images. Despite this, in the context of novel view synthesis, each type of primitive has its inherent defects in terms of representation ability. It is difficult to exploit the mesh to depict the fuzzy geometry. Meanwhile, the point-based splatting (e.g. the 3D Gaussian Splatting) method usually produces artifacts or blurry pixels in the area with smooth geometry and sharp textures. As a result, it is difficult, even not impossible, to represent the complex and dynamic scene with a single type of primitive. To this end, we propose a novel approach, GauMesh, to bridge the 3D Gaussian and Mesh for modeling and rendering the dynamic scenes. Given a sequence of tracked mesh as initialization, our goal is to simultaneously optimize the mesh geometry, color texture, opacity maps, a set of 3D Gaussians, and the deformation field. At a specific time, we perform $\xce\xb1$-blending on the RGB and opacity values based on the merged and re-ordered z-buffers from mesh and 3D Gaussian rasterizations. This produces the final rendering, which is supervised by the ground-truth image. Experiments demonstrate that our approach adapts the appropriate type of primitives to represent the different parts of the dynamic scene and outperforms all the baseline methods in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons without losing render speed.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11453](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11453) |
| 40 | Motion-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting for Efficient Dynamic Scene Reconstruction | Zhiyang Guo,Wengang Zhou,Li Li,Min Wang,Houqiang Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become an emerging tool for dynamic scene reconstruction. However, existing methods focus mainly on extending static 3DGS into a time-variant representation, while overlooking the rich motion information carried by 2D observations, thus suffering from performance degradation and model redundancy. To address the above problem, we propose a novel motion-aware enhancement framework for dynamic scene reconstruction, which mines useful motion cues from optical flow to improve different paradigms of dynamic 3DGS. Specifically, we first establish a correspondence between 3D Gaussian movements and pixel-level flow. Then a novel flow augmentation method is introduced with additional insights into uncertainty and loss collaboration. Moreover, for the prevalent deformation-based paradigm that presents a harder optimization problem, a transient-aware deformation auxiliary module is proposed. We conduct extensive experiments on both multi-view and monocular scenes to verify the merits of our work. Compared with the baselines, our method shows significant superiority in both rendering quality and efficiency.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11447](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11447) |
| 39 | BAGS: Building Animatable Gaussian Splatting from a Monocular Video with Diffusion Priors | Tingyang Zhang,Qingzhe Gao,Weiyu Li,Libin Liu,Baoquan Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Animatable 3D reconstruction has significant applications across various fields, primarily relying on artists' handcraft creation. Recently, some studies have successfully constructed animatable 3D models from monocular videos. However, these approaches require sufficient view coverage of the object within the input video and typically necessitate significant time and computational costs for training and rendering. This limitation restricts the practical applications. In this work, we propose a method to build animatable 3D Gaussian Splatting from monocular video with diffusion priors. The 3D Gaussian representations significantly accelerate the training and rendering process, and the diffusion priors allow the method to learn 3D models with limited viewpoints. We also present the rigid regularization to enhance the utilization of the priors. We perform an extensive evaluation across various real-world videos, demonstrating its superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11427](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11427) |

To further enhance these capabilities, we incorporate additional sampled views from the environment with the RF model. One of our key contributions is the introduction of Risk-aware Environment Masking (RaEM), which prioritizes crucial information by selecting the next-best-view that maximizes the expected information gain. This targeted approach aims to minimize uncertainties surrounding the robot's path and enhance the safety of its navigation. Our method offers a dual benefit: improved robot safety and increased efficiency in risk-aware 3D scene reconstruction and understanding. Extensive experiments in real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting its potential to establish a robust and safety-focused framework for active robot exploration and 3D scene understanding.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11396](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11396) |

Our proposed method uses LiDAR and camera data to create accurate and visually plausible representations of the environment. By leveraging LiDAR data to initiate the training of the 3D Gaussian Splatting map, our system constructs maps that are both detailed and geometrically accurate. To mitigate excessive GPU memory usage and facilitate rapid spatial queries, we employ a combination of a 2D voxel map and a KD-tree. This preparation makes our method well-suited for visual localization tasks, enabling efficient identification of correspondences between the query image and the rendered image from the Gaussian Splatting map via normalized cross-correlation (NCC). Additionally, we refine the camera pose of the query image using feature-based matching and the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. The effectiveness, adaptability, and precision of our system are demonstrated through extensive evaluation on the KITTI360 dataset.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11367](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11367) |
| 36 | Creating Seamless 3D Maps Using Radiance Fields | Sai Tarun Sathyan,Thomas B. Kinsman | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>It is desirable to create 3D object models and 3D maps from 2D input images for applications such as navigation, virtual tourism, and urban planning. The traditional methods of creating 3D maps, (such as photogrammetry), require a large number of images and odometry. Additionally, traditional methods have difficulty with reflective surfaces and specular reflections; windows and chrome in the scene can be problematic. Google Road View is a familiar application, which uses traditional methods to fuse a collection of 2D input images into the illusion of a 3D map. However, Google Road View does not create an actual 3D object model, only a collection of views. The objective of this work is to create an actual 3D object model using updated techniques. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF[1]) has emerged as a potential solution, offering the capability to produce more precise and intricate 3D maps. Gaussian Splatting[4] is another contemporary technique. This investigation compares Neural Radiance Fields to Gaussian Splatting, and describes some of their inner workings. Our primary contribution is a method for improving the results of the 3D reconstructed models. Our results indicate that Gaussian Splatting was superior to the NeRF technique.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11364](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11364) |
| 35 | BrightDreamer: Generic 3D Gaussian Generative Framework for Fast Text-to-3D Synthesis | Lutao Jiang,Lin Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image models with 3D representation methods, e.g., Gaussian Splatting (GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to one-stage generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. A hurdle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end single-stage approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH coefficient), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the triplane feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts.

| 34 | Texture-GS: Disentangling the Geometry and Texture for 3D Gaussian Splatting Editing | Tian-Xing Xu,Wenbo Hu,Yu-Kun Lai,Ying Shan,Song-Hai Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian splatting, emerging as a groundbreaking approach, has drawn increasing attention for its capabilities of high-fidelity reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, it couples the appearance and geometry of the scene within the Gaussian attributes, which hinders the flexibility of editing operations, such as texture swapping. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, namely Texture-GS, to disentangle the appearance from the geometry by representing it as a 2D texture mapped onto the 3D surface, thereby facilitating appearance editing. Technically, the disentanglement is achieved by our proposed texture mapping module, which consists of a UV mapping MLP to learn the UV coordinates for the 3D Gaussian centers, a local Taylor expansion of the MLP to efficiently approximate the UV coordinates for the ray-Gaussian intersections, and a learnable texture to capture the fine-grained appearance. Extensive experiments on the DTU dataset demonstrate that our method not only facilitates high-fidelity appearance editing but also achieves real-time rendering on consumer-level devices, e.g. a single RTX 2080 Ti GPU.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10050](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10050) |

Such technology facilitates robots in executing object manipulations based on human language directives. To tackle this challenge, some research efforts have been dedicated to the development of language-embedded implicit fields. However, implicit fields (e.g. NeRF) encounter limitations due to the necessity of processing a large number of input views for reconstruction, coupled with their inherent inefficiencies in inference. Thus, we present the GaussianGrasper, which utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to explicitly represent the scene as a collection of Gaussian primitives. Our approach takes a limited set of RGB-D views and employs a tile-based splatting technique to create a feature field. In particular, we propose an Efficient Feature Distillation (EFD) module that employs contrastive learning to efficiently and accurately distill language embeddings derived from foundational models. With the reconstructed geometry of the Gaussian field, our method enables the pre-trained grasping model to generate collision-free grasp pose candidates. Furthermore, we propose a normal-guided grasp module to select the best grasp pose. Through comprehensive real-world experiments, we demonstrate that GaussianGrasper enables robots to accurately query and grasp objects with language instructions, providing a new solution for language-guided manipulation tasks.

| 32 | HumanGaussian: Text-Driven 3D Human Generation with Gaussian Splatting | Xian Liu,Xiaohang Zhan,Jiaxiang Tang,Ying Shan,Gang Zeng,Dahua Lin,Xihui Liu,Ziwei Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Realistic 3D human generation from text prompts is a desirable yet challenging task. Existing methods optimize 3D representations like mesh or neural fields via score distillation sampling (SDS), which suffers from inadequate fine details or excessive training time. In this paper, we propose an efficient yet effective framework, HumanGaussian, that generates high-quality 3D humans with fine-grained geometry and realistic appearance. Our key insight is that 3D Gaussian Splatting is an efficient renderer with periodic Gaussian shrinkage or growing, where such adaptive density control can be naturally guided by intrinsic human structures. Specifically, 1) we first propose a Structure-Aware SDS that simultaneously optimizes human appearance and geometry. The multi-modal score function from both RGB and depth space is leveraged to distill the Gaussian densification and pruning process. 2) Moreover, we devise an Annealed Negative Prompt Guidance by decomposing SDS into a noisier generative score and a cleaner classifier score, which well addresses the over-saturation issue. The floating artifacts are further eliminated based on Gaussian size in a prune-only phase to enhance generation smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and competitive quality of our framework, rendering vivid 3D humans under diverse scenarios.

| 31 | A New Split Algorithm for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Qiyuan Feng,Gengchen Cao,Haoxiang Chen,Tai-Jiang Mu,Ralph R. Martin,Shi-Min Hu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian splatting models, as a novel explicit 3D representation, have been applied in many domains recently, such as explicit geometric editing and geometry generation. Progress has been rapid. However, due to their mixed scales and cluttered shapes, 3D Gaussian splatting models can produce a blurred or needle-like effect near the surface. At the same time, 3D Gaussian splatting models tend to flatten large untextured regions, yielding a very sparse point cloud. These problems are caused by the non-uniform nature of 3D Gaussian splatting models, so in this paper, we propose a new 3D Gaussian splitting algorithm, which can produce a more uniform and surface-bounded 3D Gaussian splatting model. Our algorithm splits an $N$-dimensional Gaussian into two N-dimensional Gaussians. It ensures consistency of mathematical characteristics and similarity of appearance, allowing resulting 3D Gaussian splatting models to be more uniform and a better fit to the underlying surface, and thus more suitable for explicit editing, point cloud extraction and other tasks. Meanwhile, our 3D Gaussian splitting approach has a very simple closed-form solution, making it readily applicable to any 3D Gaussian model.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09143](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09143) |
| 30 | StyleGaussian: Instant 3D Style Transfer with Gaussian Splatting | Kunhao Liu,Fangneng Zhan,Muyu Xu,Christian Theobalt,Ling Shao,Shijian Lu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce StyleGaussian, a novel 3D style transfer technique that allows instant transfer of any image's style to a 3D scene at 10 frames per second (fps). Leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), StyleGaussian achieves style transfer without compromising its real-time rendering ability and multi-view consistency. It achieves instant style transfer with three steps: embedding, transfer, and decoding. Initially, 2D VGG scene features are embedded into reconstructed 3D Gaussians. Next, the embedded features are transformed according to a reference style image. Finally, the transformed features are decoded into the stylized RGB. StyleGaussian has two novel designs. The first is an efficient feature rendering strategy that first renders low-dimensional features and then maps them into high-dimensional features while embedding VGG features. It cuts the memory consumption significantly and enables 3DGS to render the high-dimensional memory-intensive features. The second is a K-nearest-neighbor-based 3D CNN. Working as the decoder for the stylized features, it eliminates the 2D CNN operations that compromise strict multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments show that StyleGaussian achieves instant 3D stylization with superior stylization quality while preserving real-time rendering and strict multi-view consistency.

We disentangle the motion and appearance of a virtual human with explicit mesh geometry and implicit appearance modeling with Gaussian Splatting. The Gaussians are defined by barycentric coordinates and displacement on a triangle mesh as Phong surfaces. We extend lifted optimization to simultaneously optimize the parameters of the Gaussians while walking on the triangle mesh. SplattingAvatar is a hybrid representation of virtual humans where the mesh represents low-frequency motion and surface deformation, while the Gaussians take over the high-frequency geometry and detailed appearance. Unlike existing deformation methods that rely on an MLP-based linear blend skinning (LBS) field for motion, we control the rotation and translation of the Gaussians directly by mesh, which empowers its compatibility with various animation techniques, e.g., skeletal animation, blend shapes, and mesh editing. Trainable from monocular videos for both full-body and head avatars, SplattingAvatar shows state-of-the-art rendering quality across multiple datasets.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05087](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05087) |
| 28 | 3D Gaussian Model for Animation and Texturing | Xiangzhi Eric Wang,Zackary P. T. Sin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting has made a marked impact on neural rendering by achieving impressive fidelity and performance. Despite this achievement, however, it is not readily applicable to developing interactive applications. Real-time applications like XR apps and games require functions such as animation, UV-mapping, and model editing simultaneously manipulated through the usage of a 3D model. We propose a modeling that is analogous to typical 3D models, which we call 3D Gaussian Model (3DGM); it provides a manipulatable proxy for novel animation and texture transfer. By binding the 3D Gaussians in texture space and re-projecting them back to world space through implicit shell mapping, we show how our 3D modeling can serve as a valid rendering methodology for interactive applications. It is further noted that recently, 3D mesh reconstruction works have been able to produce high-quality mesh for rendering. Our work, on the other hand, only requires an approximated geometry for rendering an object in high fidelity. Applicationwise, we will show that our proxy-based 3DGM is capable of driving novel animation without animated training data and texture transferring via UV mapping of the 3D Gaussians. We believe the result indicates the potential of our work for enabling interactive applications for 3D Gaussian Splatting.</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19441](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19441) |

While the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting works well on small-scale and object-centric scenes, scaling it up to large scenes poses challenges due to limited video memory, long optimization time, and noticeable appearance variations. To address these challenges, we present VastGaussian, the first method for high-quality reconstruction and real-time rendering on large scenes based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. We propose a progressive partitioning strategy to divide a large scene into multiple cells, where the training cameras and point cloud are properly distributed with an airspace-aware visibility criterion. These cells are merged into a complete scene after parallel optimization. We also introduce decoupled appearance modeling into the optimization process to reduce appearance variations in the rendered images.

| 26 | SplatFlow: Learning Multi-frame Optical Flow via Splatting | Bo Wang,Yifan Zhang,Jian Li,Yang Yu,Zhenping Sun,Li Liu,Dewen Hu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The occlusion problem remains a crucial challenge in optical flow estimation (OFE). Despite the recent significant progress brought about by deep learning, most existing deep learning OFE methods still struggle to handle occlusions; in particular, those based on two frames cannot correctly handle occlusions because occluded regions have no visual correspondences. However, there is still hope in multi-frame settings, which can potentially mitigate the occlusion issue in OFE. Unfortunately, multi-frame OFE (MOFE) remains underexplored, and the limited studies on it are mainly specially designed for pyramid backbones or else obtain the aligned previous frame's features, such as correlation volume and optical flow, through time-consuming backward flow calculation or non-differentiable forward warping transformation. This study proposes an efficient MOFE framework named SplatFlow to address these shortcomings. SplatFlow introduces the differentiable splatting transformation to align the previous frame's motion feature and designs a Final-to-All embedding method to input the aligned motion feature into the current frame's estimation, thus remodeling the existing two-frame backbones. The proposed SplatFlow is efficient yet more accurate, as it can handle occlusions properly. Extensive experimental evaluations show that SplatFlow substantially outperforms all published methods on the KITTI2015 and Sintel benchmarks. Especially on the Sintel benchmark, SplatFlow achieves errors of 1.12 (clean pass) and 2.07 (final pass), with surprisingly significant 19.4% and 16.2% error reductions, respectively, from the previous best results submitted. The code for SplatFlow is available at https://github.com/wwsource/SplatFlow.</details> | June 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08887](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08887) |
| 25 | GaussianPro: 3D Gaussian Splatting with Progressive Propagation | Kai Cheng,Xiaoxiao Long,Kaizhi Yang,Yao Yao,Wei Yin,Yuexin Ma,Wenping Wang,Xuejin Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently brought about a revolution in the field of neural rendering, facilitating high-quality renderings at real-time speed. However, 3DGS heavily depends on the initialized point cloud produced by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques. When tackling with large-scale scenes that unavoidably contain texture-less surfaces, the SfM techniques always fail to produce enough points in these surfaces and cannot provide good initialization for 3DGS. As a result, 3DGS suffers from difficult optimization and low-quality renderings. In this paper, inspired by classical multi-view stereo (MVS) techniques, we propose GaussianPro, a novel method that applies a progressive propagation strategy to guide the densification of the 3D Gaussians. Compared to the simple split and clone strategies used in 3DGS, our method leverages the priors of the existing reconstructed geometries of the scene and patch matching techniques to produce new Gaussians with accurate positions and orientations. Experiments on both large-scale and small-scale scenes validate the effectiveness of our method, where our method significantly surpasses 3DGS on the Waymo dataset, exhibiting an improvement of 1.15dB in terms of PSNR.</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14650](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14650) |
| 24 | Real-time Photorealistic Dynamic Scene Representation and Rendering with 4D Gaussian Splatting | Zeyu Yang,Hongye Yang,Zijie Pan,Li Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from 2D images and generating diverse views over time is challenging due to scene complexity and temporal dynamics. Despite advancements in neural implicit models, limitations persist: (i) Inadequate Scene Structure: Existing methods struggle to reveal the spatial and temporal structure of dynamic scenes from directly learning the complex 6D plenoptic function. (ii) Scaling Deformation Modeling: Explicitly modeling scene element deformation becomes impractical for complex dynamics. To address these issues, we consider the spacetime as an entirety and propose to approximate the underlying spatio-temporal 4D volume of a dynamic scene by optimizing a collection of 4D primitives, with explicit geometry and appearance modeling. Learning to optimize the 4D primitives enables us to synthesize novel views at any desired time with our tailored rendering routine. Our model is conceptually simple, consisting of a 4D Gaussian parameterized by anisotropic ellipses that can rotate arbitrarily in space and time, as well as view-dependent and time-evolved appearance represented by the coefficient of 4D spherindrical harmonics. This approach offers simplicity, flexibility for variable-length video and end-to-end training, and efficient real-time rendering, making it suitable for capturing complex dynamic scene motions.

| 23 | Compact 3D Gaussian Representation for Radiance Field | Joo Chan Lee,Daniel Rho,Xiangyu Sun,Jong Hwan Ko,Eunbyung Park | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in capturing complex 3D scenes with high fidelity. However, one persistent challenge that hinders the widespread adoption of NeRFs is the computational bottleneck due to the volumetric rendering. On the other hand, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an alternative representation that leverages a 3D Gaussisan-based representation and adopts the rasterization pipeline to render the images rather than volumetric rendering, achieving very fast rendering speed and promising image quality. However, a significant drawback arises as 3DGS entails a substantial number of 3D Gaussians to maintain the high fidelity of the rendered images, which requires a large amount of memory and storage. To address this critical issue, we place a specific emphasis on two key objectives: reducing the number of Gaussian points without sacrificing performance and compressing the Gaussian attributes, such as view-dependent color and covariance. To this end, we propose a learnable mask strategy that significantly reduces the number of Gaussians while preserving high performance. In addition, we propose a compact but effective representation of view-dependent color by employing a grid-based neural field rather than relying on spherical harmonics. Finally, we learn codebooks to compactly represent the geometric attributes of Gaussian by vector quantization. With model compression techniques such as quantization and entropy coding, we consistently show over 25$\\times$ reduced storage and enhanced rendering speed, while maintaining the quality of the scene representation, compared to 3DGS. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for 3D scene representation, achieving high performance, fast training, compactness, and real-time rendering.

One such widely-researched neural radiance field (NeRF) relies on a neural network to represent 3D scenes, allowing for realistic view synthesis from a small number of 2D images. However, most NeRF models are constrained by long training and inference times. In comparison, Gaussian Splatting (GS) is a novel, state-of-the-art technique for rendering points in a 3D scene by approximating their contribution to image pixels through Gaussian distributions, warranting fast training and swift, real-time rendering. A drawback of GS is the absence of a well-defined approach for its conditioning due to the necessity to condition several hundred thousand Gaussian components. To solve this, we introduce the Gaussian Mesh Splatting (GaMeS) model, which allows modification of Gaussian components in a similar way as meshes. We parameterize each Gaussian component by the vertices of the mesh face. Furthermore, our model needs mesh initialization on input or estimated mesh during training. We also define Gaussian splats solely based on their location on the mesh, allowing for automatic adjustments in position, scale, and rotation during animation. As a result, we obtain a real-time rendering of editable GS.</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01459](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01459) |

They use variants of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which is slow, somewhat unstable, and prone to artifacts. A mitigation is to fine-tune the 2D generator to be multi-view aware, which can help distillation or can be combined with reconstruction networks to output 3D objects directly. In this paper, we further explore the design space of text-to-3D models. We significantly improve multi-view generation by considering video instead of image generators. Combined with a 3D reconstruction algorithm which, by using Gaussian splatting, can optimize a robust image-based loss, we directly produce high-quality 3D outputs from the generated views. Our new method, IM-3D, reduces the number of evaluations of the 2D generator network 10-100x, resulting in a much more efficient pipeline, better quality, fewer geometric inconsistencies, and higher yield of usable 3D assets.</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08682](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08682) |

However, the discrete representations of point cloud lost the object's surface shape information and creates a gap between rendering results and 2D correspondences. To address this problem, we propose GS-CLIP for the first attempt to introduce 3DGS (3D Gaussian Splatting) into multimodal pre-training to enhance 3D representation. GS-CLIP leverages a pre-trained vision-language model for a learned common visual and textual space on massive real world image-text pairs and then learns a 3D Encoder for aligning 3DGS optimized per object. Additionally, a novel Gaussian-Aware Fusion is proposed to extract and fuse global explicit feature. As a general framework for language-image-3D pre-training, GS-CLIP is agnostic to 3D backbone networks. Experiments on challenging shows that GS-CLIP significantly improves the state-of-the-art, outperforming the previously best results.</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06198](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06198) |
| 19 | EndoGaussian: Real-time Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Endoscopic Scene Reconstruction | Yifan Liu,Chenxin Li,Chen Yang,Yixuan Yuan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing deformable tissues from endoscopic videos is essential in many downstream surgical applications. However, existing methods suffer from slow rendering speed, greatly limiting their practical use. In this paper, we introduce EndoGaussian, a real-time endoscopic scene reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By integrating the efficient Gaussian representation and highly-optimized rendering engine, our framework significantly boosts the rendering speed to a real-time level. To adapt 3DGS for endoscopic scenes, we propose two strategies, Holistic Gaussian Initialization (HGI) and Spatio-temporal Gaussian Tracking (SGT), to handle the non-trivial Gaussian initialization and tissue deformation problems, respectively. In HGI, we leverage recent depth estimation models to predict depth maps of input binocular/monocular image sequences, based on which pixels are re-projected and combined for holistic initialization. In SPT, we propose to model surface dynamics using a deformation field, which is composed of an efficient encoding voxel and a lightweight deformation decoder, allowing for Gaussian tracking with minor training and rendering burden. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate our efficacy against prior SOTAs in many aspects, including better rendering speed (195 FPS real-time, 100$\\times$ gain), better rendering quality (37.848 PSNR), and less training overhead (within 2 min/scene), showing significant promise for intraoperative surgery applications.

Among the most promising breakthroughs are the recent rise of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). NeRFs encode the object's shape and color in neural network weights using a handful of images with known camera positions to generate novel views. In contrast, GS provides accelerated training and inference without a decrease in rendering quality by encoding the object's characteristics in a collection of Gaussian distributions. These two techniques have found many use cases in spatial computing and other domains. On the other hand, the emergence of deepfake methods has sparked considerable controversy. Such techniques can have a form of artificial intelligence-generated videos that closely mimic authentic footage. Using generative models, they can modify facial features, enabling the creation of altered identities or facial expressions that exhibit a remarkably realistic appearance to a real person. Despite these controversies, deepfake can offer a next-generation solution for avatar creation and gaming when of desirable quality. To that end, we show how to combine all these emerging technologies to obtain a more plausible outcome. Our ImplicitDeepfake1 uses the classical deepfake algorithm to modify all training images separately and then train NeRF and GS on modified faces. Such relatively simple strategies can produce plausible 3D deepfake-based avatars.</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06390](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06390) |
| 17 | HeadStudio: Text to Animatable Head Avatars with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Zhenglin Zhou,Fan Ma,Hehe Fan,Yi Yang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Creating digital avatars from textual prompts has long been a desirable yet challenging task. Despite the promising outcomes obtained through 2D diffusion priors in recent works, current methods face challenges in achieving high-quality and animated avatars effectively. In this paper, we present $\\textbf{HeadStudio}$, a novel framework that utilizes 3D Gaussian splatting to generate realistic and animated avatars from text prompts. Our method drives 3D Gaussians semantically to create a flexible and achievable appearance through the intermediate FLAME representation. Specifically, we incorporate the FLAME into both 3D representation and score distillation: 1) FLAME-based 3D Gaussian splatting, driving 3D Gaussian points by rigging each point to a FLAME mesh. 2) FLAME-based score distillation sampling, utilizing FLAME-based fine-grained control signal to guide score distillation from the text prompt. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of HeadStudio in generating animatable avatars from textual prompts, exhibiting visually appealing appearances. The avatars are capable of rendering high-quality real-time ($\\geq 40$ fps) novel views at a resolution of 1024. They can be smoothly controlled by real-world speech and video. We hope that HeadStudio can advance digital avatar creation and that the present method can widely be applied across various domains.</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06149](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06149) |
| 16 | Neural Graphics Primitives-based Deformable Image Registration for On-the-fly Motion Extraction | Xia Li,Fabian Zhang,Muheng Li,Damien Weber,Antony Lomax,Joachim Buhmann,Ye Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Intra-fraction motion in radiotherapy is commonly modeled using deformable image registration (DIR). However, existing methods often struggle to balance speed and accuracy, limiting their applicability in clinical scenarios. This study introduces a novel approach that harnesses Neural Graphics Primitives (NGP) to optimize the displacement vector field (DVF). Our method leverages learned primitives, processed as splats, and interpolates within space using a shallow neural network. Uniquely, it enables self-supervised optimization at an ultra-fast speed, negating the need for pre-training on extensive datasets and allowing seamless adaptation to new cases. We validated this approach on the 4D-CT lung dataset DIR-lab, achieving a target registration error (TRE) of 1.15\\pm1.15 mm within a remarkable time of 1.77 seconds. Notably, our method also addresses the sliding boundary problem, a common challenge in conventional DIR methods.</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05568](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05568) |
| 15 | Mesh-based Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Large-scale Deformation | Lin Gao,Jie Yang,Bo-Tao Zhang,Jia-Mu Sun,Yu-Jie Yuan,Hongbo Fu,Yu-Kun Lai | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Neural implicit representations, including Neural Distance Fields and Neural Radiance Fields, have demonstrated significant capabilities for reconstructing surfaces with complicated geometry and topology, and generating novel views of a scene. Nevertheless, it is challenging for users to directly deform or manipulate these implicit representations with large deformations in the real-time fashion. Gaussian Splatting(GS) has recently become a promising method with explicit geometry for representing static scenes and facilitating high-quality and real-time synthesis of novel views. However,it cannot be easily deformed due to the use of discrete Gaussians and lack of explicit topology. To address this, we develop a novel GS-based method that enables interactive deformation. Our key idea is to design an innovative mesh-based GS representation, which is integrated into Gaussian learning and manipulation. 3D Gaussians are defined over an explicit mesh, and they are bound with each other: the rendering of 3D Gaussians guides the mesh face split for adaptive refinement, and the mesh face split directs the splitting of 3D Gaussians. Moreover, the explicit mesh constraints help regularize the Gaussian distribution, suppressing poor-quality Gaussians(e.g. misaligned Gaussians,long-narrow shaped Gaussians), thus enhancing visual quality and avoiding artifacts during deformation. Based on this representation, we further introduce a large-scale Gaussian deformation technique to enable deformable GS, which alters the parameters of 3D Gaussians according to the manipulation of the associated mesh. Our method benefits from existing mesh deformation datasets for more realistic data-driven Gaussian deformation. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves high-quality reconstruction and effective deformation, while maintaining the promising rendering results at a high frame rate(65 FPS on average).</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04796](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04796) |
| 14 | Rig3DGS: Creating Controllable Portraits from Casual Monocular Videos | Alfredo Rivero,ShahRukh Athar,Zhixin Shu,Dimitris Samaras | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Creating controllable 3D human portraits from casual smartphone videos is highly desirable due to their immense value in AR/VR applications. The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown improvements in rendering quality and training efficiency. However, it still remains a challenge to accurately model and disentangle head movements and facial expressions from a single-view capture to achieve high-quality renderings. In this paper, we introduce Rig3DGS to address this challenge. We represent the entire scene, including the dynamic subject, using a set of 3D Gaussians in a canonical space. Using a set of control signals, such as head pose and expressions, we transform them to the 3D space with learned deformations to generate the desired rendering. Our key innovation is a carefully designed deformation method which is guided by a learnable prior derived from a 3D morphable model. This approach is highly efficient in training and effective in controlling facial expressions, head positions, and view synthesis across various captures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned deformation through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments.

| 13 | 360-GS: Layout-guided Panoramic Gaussian Splatting For Indoor Roaming | Jiayang Bai,Letian Huang,Jie Guo,Wen Gong,Yuanqi Li,Yanwen Guo | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted great attention with real-time and photo-realistic renderings. This technique typically takes perspective images as input and optimizes a set of 3D elliptical Gaussians by splatting them onto the image planes, resulting in 2D Gaussians. However, applying 3D-GS to panoramic inputs presents challenges in effectively modeling the projection onto the spherical surface of ${360^\\circ}$ images using 2D Gaussians. In practical applications, input panoramas are often sparse, leading to unreliable initialization of 3D Gaussians and subsequent degradation of 3D-GS quality. In addition, due to the under-constrained geometry of texture-less planes (e.g., walls and floors), 3D-GS struggles to model these flat regions with elliptical Gaussians, resulting in significant floaters in novel views. To address these issues, we propose 360-GS, a novel $360^{\\circ}$ Gaussian splatting for a limited set of panoramic inputs. Instead of splatting 3D Gaussians directly onto the spherical surface, 360-GS projects them onto the tangent plane of the unit sphere and then maps them to the spherical projections. This adaptation enables the representation of the projection using Gaussians. We guide the optimization of 360-GS by exploiting layout priors within panoramas, which are simple to obtain and contain strong structural information about the indoor scene. Our experimental results demonstrate that 360-GS allows panoramic rendering and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer artifacts in novel view synthesis, thus providing immersive roaming in indoor scenarios.</details> | February 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00763) |

Compared with the costly neural radiance based models, 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently demonstrated great performance in terms of training time and rendering quality. However, applying the static 3D Gaussian Splatting model to the dynamic human reconstruction problem is non-trivial due to complicated non-rigid deformations and rich cloth details. To address these challenges, our method considers explicit pose-guided deformation to associate dynamic Gaussians across the canonical space and the observation space, introducing a physically-based prior with regularized transformations helps mitigate ambiguity between the two spaces. During the training process, we further propose a pose refinement strategy to update the pose regression for compensating the inaccurate initial estimation and a split-with-scale mechanism to enhance the density of regressed point clouds. The experiments validate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art photorealistic novel-view rendering results with high-quality details for dynamic clothed human bodies, along with explicit geometry reconstruction.</details> | January 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09720](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09720) |

Comprising an encoder utilizing models like vision transformers for feature extraction and a slicer employing a learnable bilateral grid, the Slicer Network strategically refines and upsamples feature maps via a splatting-blurring-slicing process. This introduces an edge-preserving low-frequency approximation for the network outcome, effectively enlarging the effective receptive field. The enhancement not only reduces computational complexity but also boosts overall performance. Experiments across different medical imaging applications, including unsupervised and keypoints-based image registration and lesion segmentation, have verified the Slicer Network's improved accuracy and efficiency.</details> | January 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09833](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09833) |

| 6 | Gaussian Shadow Casting for Neural Characters | Luis Bolanos,Shih-Yang Su,Helge Rhodin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Neural character models can now reconstruct detailed geometry and texture from video, but they lack explicit shadows and shading, leading to artifacts when generating novel views and poses or during relighting. It is particularly difficult to include shadows as they are a global effect and the required casting of secondary rays is costly. We propose a new shadow model using a Gaussian density proxy that replaces sampling with a simple analytic formula. It supports dynamic motion and is tailored for shadow computation, thereby avoiding the affine projection approximation and sorting required by the closely related Gaussian splatting. Combined with a deferred neural rendering model, our Gaussian shadows enable Lambertian shading and shadow casting with minimal overhead. We demonstrate improved reconstructions, with better separation of albedo, shading, and shadows in challenging outdoor scenes with direct sun light and hard shadows. Our method is able to optimize the light direction without any input from the user. As a result, novel poses have fewer shadow artifacts and relighting in novel scenes is more realistic compared to the state-of-the-art methods, providing new ways to pose neural characters in novel environments, increasing their applicability.</details> | January 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06116](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06116) |

Due to its superior rendering efficiency, 3D Gaussian splatting-based models have recently excelled in both 3D reconstruction and generation. 3D Gaussian splatting approaches for image to 3D generation are often optimization-based, requiring many computationally expensive score-distillation steps. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an Amortized Generative 3D Gaussian framework (AGG) that instantly produces 3D Gaussians from a single image, eliminating the need for per-instance optimization. Utilizing an intermediate hybrid representation, AGG decomposes the generation of 3D Gaussian locations and other appearance attributes for joint optimization. Moreover, we propose a cascaded pipeline that first generates a coarse representation of the 3D data and later upsamples it with a 3D Gaussian super-resolution module. Our method is evaluated against existing optimization-based 3D Gaussian frameworks and sampling-based pipelines utilizing other 3D representations, where AGG showcases competitive generation abilities both qualitatively and quantitatively while being several orders of magnitude faster.

Since the year 2023 an abundant amount of research papers has emerged in the domain of 3D generation. This growth encompasses not just the creation of 3D objects, but also the rapid development of 3D character and motion generation. Several key factors contribute to this progress. The enhanced fidelity in stable diffusion, coupled with control methods that ensure multi-view consistency, and realistic human models like SMPL-X, contribute synergistically to the production of 3D models with remarkable consistency and near-realistic appearances. The advancements in neural network-based 3D storing and rendering models, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have accelerated the efficiency and realism of neural rendered models. Furthermore, the multimodality capabilities of large language models have enabled language inputs to transcend into human motion outputs.

| 3 | Characterizing Satellite Geometry via Accelerated 3D Gaussian Splatting | Van Minh Nguyen,Emma Sandidge,Trupti Mahendrakar,Ryan T. White | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The accelerating deployment of spacecraft in orbit have generated interest in on-orbit servicing (OOS), inspection of spacecraft, and active debris removal (ADR). Such missions require precise rendezvous and proximity operations in the vicinity of non-cooperative, possible unknown, resident space objects. Safety concerns with manned missions and lag times with ground-based control necessitate complete autonomy. This requires robust characterization of the target's geometry. In this article, we present an approach for mapping geometries of satellites on orbit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that can run on computing resources available on current spaceflight hardware. We demonstrate model training and 3D rendering performance on a hardware-in-the-loop satellite mock-up under several realistic lighting and motion conditions. Our model is shown to be capable of training on-board and rendering higher quality novel views of an unknown satellite nearly 2 orders of magnitude faster than previous NeRF-based algorithms.

| 2 | Depth-Regularized Optimization for 3D Gaussian Splatting in Few-Shot Images | Jaeyoung Chung,Jeongtaek Oh,Kyoung Mu Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we present a method to optimize Gaussian splatting with a limited number of images while avoiding overfitting. Representing a 3D scene by combining numerous Gaussian splats has yielded outstanding visual quality. However, it tends to overfit the training views when only a small number of images are available. To address this issue, we introduce a dense depth map as a geometry guide to mitigate overfitting. We obtained the depth map using a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model and aligning the scale and offset using sparse COLMAP feature points. The adjusted depth aids in the color-based optimization of 3D Gaussian splatting, mitigating floating artifacts, and ensuring adherence to geometric constraints. We verify the proposed method on the NeRF-LLFF dataset with varying numbers of few images. Our approach demonstrates robust geometry compared to the original method that relies solely on images.

| 1 | Align Your Gaussians: Text-to-4D with Dynamic 3D Gaussians and Composed Diffusion Models | Huan Ling,Seung Wook Kim,Antonio Torralba,Sanja Fidler,Karsten Kreis | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Text-guided diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation and have also been successfully used for optimization-based 3D object synthesis. Here, we instead focus on the underexplored text-to-4D setting and synthesize dynamic, animated 3D objects using score distillation methods with an additional temporal dimension. Compared to previous work, we pursue a novel compositional generation-based approach, and combine text-to-image, text-to-video, and 3D-aware multiview diffusion models to provide feedback during 4D object optimization, thereby simultaneously enforcing temporal consistency, high-quality visual appearance and realistic geometry. Our method, called Align Your Gaussians (AYG), leverages dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting with deformation fields as 4D representation. Crucial to AYG is a novel method to regularize the distribution of the moving 3D Gaussians and thereby stabilize the optimization and induce motion. We also propose a motion amplification mechanism as well as a new autoregressive synthesis scheme to generate and combine multiple 4D sequences for longer generation. These techniques allow us to synthesize vivid dynamic scenes, outperform previous work qualitatively and quantitatively and achieve state-of-the-art text-to-4D performance. Due to the Gaussian 4D representation, different 4D animations can be seamlessly combined, as we demonstrate. AYG opens up promising avenues for animation, simulation and digital content creation as well as synthetic data generation.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13763) |
